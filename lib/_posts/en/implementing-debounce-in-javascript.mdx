Possibly one of the most used functions in the world of Javascript is (besides [throttle](/blog/implementing-throttle-in-vanilla-javascript)) **debounce**. So much so that many times it is the only function I end up importing from [lodash](https://lodash.com/), but, as small as the `lodash` library may be, **isn't it too much to import a new library just for one function?**

That's why many times it can be more beneficial to **implement our own versions of these types of utilities**, and best of all, debounce is very simple to use.

## The Problem

Before we start, let's imagine that we have a **search form** in our application, this will send a request to our _API_ to return results related to the keywords the user chooses. To help the user save precious milliseconds and a click, **we will not add a search button**, the form will do it automatically:

```jsx
<form>
  <label htmlFor='search1' className='block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700'>
    Enter a keyword
  </label>
  <input
    type='text'
    id='search1'
    name='search1'
    className='mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 p-2 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500 sm:text-sm'
  />
</form>
```

This will result in:

<AlignWide>
  <ExampleOne />
</AlignWide>

Now, let's say that before connecting our form to our API, we want to make sure it works, so we want to print the value of this field in the console (you can open the browser console and try the field yourself üòâÔ∏è)

Simply add a `console.log` to the change function:

```jsx
<form>
  <label htmlFor='search1' className='block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700'>
    Enter a keyword
  </label>
  <input
    type='text'
    id='search1'
    name='search1'
    className='mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 p-2 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500 sm:text-sm'
    onChange={(e) => {
      console.log(e.target.value);
    }}
  />
</form>
```

## The Solution

This is where _debounce_ comes in, what we are going to do is **wait for the user to finish writing** before executing our change function, we don't need to wait long, just a few milliseconds. This way we make sure

The logic of _debounce_ is not very complicated, it is based on some very simple guidelines, which are:

1. An event is executed (such as pressing a key)
2. A _timer_ is started
3. If the _same_ event is executed again:

- The timer is cleared
- A new timer is started

4. If the timer manages to reach `0`, the function is finally executed

Now that we have the logic we need, we can move on to the fun part.

## The Implementation

Since this is a tutorial to **show the operation of debounce**, I will not resort to my usual method of using it (since my usual method is simply to use [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce)), instead, we will take the logic we wrote in the previous paragraphs and _translate it to Javascript_.

Let's start with the first step:

> An event is executed (such as pressing a key)

Fortunately, in our example we are using the `onChange` event, so this already takes care of that step.

> [!CAUTION]
> This blog, and its examples, are written in _[React](https://react.dev/)_.
>
> `onChange` is an event that is automatically added to `input` elements when they are created in React, **this is not available in conventional Javascript**, but in that case we can use the equivalent:
>
> ```js
> const input = document.querySelector('#search1');
> input.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
>   console.log(event.target.value); // Here goes our logic
> });
> ```

Before we get to the change event, it's a good idea to **save our function so we can use it in multiple places**, so we'll create the function:

```jsx
const debounce = () => {};
```

Pretty simple, now let's see.

> A _timer_ is started

To create the timer, first we need to save it in a reference (so we can clear it if necessary):

```jsx
const debounce = (callback, delay) => {
  let timer;

  return (...args) => {
    // Create a new timer.
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      // Execute the function with the arguments.
      callback(...args);
    }, delay);
  };
};
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> `return (...args)`?
>
> If you find it strange that we create a function that _returns another function_, the reason is that we need
> a function that **receives the arguments of the event, but that is executed after our timer**.
> When we see: `addEventListener('change', debounced)`, what happens is that `debounced` is executed first,
> and then `change` **sends the arguments to the function that `debounced` returns**.

> If the _same_ event is executed again:
>
> - The timer is cleared
> - A new timer is started

So far we already have our timer, and we have specified that when it finishes it will execute our function,
(this takes care of point 4), but we are missing point 3, **clear the timer if the event is repeated**.
Since we already have a reference to our timer, we can clear it with `clearTimeout`:

```jsx
const debounce = (callback, delay) => {
  // Save reference to the timer.
  let timer;

  return (...args) => {
    // Clear the timer if it exists.
    clearTimeout(timer);

    // Create a new timer.
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      // Execute the function with the arguments.
      callback(...args);
    }, delay);
  };
};
```

Our function is complete! To use it with our example, instead of starting our original function, what we do is **wrap it in our `debounce` function**, like this:

```jsx
const debounced = debounce((e) => {
  console.log(e.target.value);
}, 500);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Translating this, it would look like this:
>
> ```js
> (e) => {
>   console.log(e.target.value);
> };
> ```
>
> This would be our `callback`, and `500` would be the waiting time in milliseconds, our `delay`.

Now, instead of using our original function, **we pass our `debounced` function to the `onChange` event**:

```jsx
<input
  type='text'
  id='search1'
  name='search1'
  className='mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 p-2 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500 sm:text-sm'
  onChange={debounced}
/>
```

Or without using react:

```jsx
input.addEventListener('change', debounced)`}
/>
```

Now, if we try our search form again, we will have something similar to this:

<AlignWide>
  <ExampleTwo />
</AlignWide>

> [!TIP]
> You can try the previous example in the browser console, üòâ

![Example with debounce](/posts/implementing-debounce-in-javascript/debounced.gif)

After this, we can see a great improvement in our calls, it no longer records _each and every_ letter we put in the field, but **waits for the user to finish writing** before making the call, resulting in many **fewer and more complete calls to our API**.

## Conclusion

As we can see, this small function can be of great help, especially when we pay attention to the **user experience**, in many cases, it can benefit us to pause for a moment and wait for the user to give us some _feedback_ before continuing with our calculations.
