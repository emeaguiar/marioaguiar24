Recently I have been working on a project that uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as a language
for requests. It is an interesting project because it is what is called a
**headless CMS**, in which the backend is managed with WordPress and the frontend with
React, therefore, it is necessary to debug APIs very often; for this I use
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/). But since I have to move between applications, sometimes I need to **copy requests from Chrome to Postman**.

Fortunately, I found a very simple way to do it, and it is that Postman supports
importing via cURL, while Chrome supports exporting in the same way.

To achieve this, we only need to execute a request in Chrome,
then it will appear in our Network window in Chrome tools. Now that we have it,
we just have to right-click and select `Copyâ†’Copy as cURL`

![Copy as cURL](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyfxhbbnf/image/upload/v1731511519/copy-as-curl_eb1bzh.webp)

Pretty simple, now we can open Postman and select the **import** option,
then we can copy the cURL command that we just copied from Chrome.

Done! Now **we can see our request working in Postman** with all the
necessary headers. That's how easy it is to copy requests from Chrome to Postman.
