One of the most basic (and yet powerful) features inside WordPress is _The Loop_,
this small piece of code that we use over and over again. And yet, I find people
who called themselves a WordPress expert and **don't know what it is**, that's… sad.

Recently the company I work on bought another company overseas, and they asked
me to interview a few people to make sure they know a bit about WordPress, PHP,
Frontend and so on. My first interview went quite well, until I asked **“How do we
start The Loop in WordPress?”**, the answer shocked me. He didn't know what the
loop even was.

The Loop is a feature pretty easy to understand, so I decided to write a little
bit about it.

## What is a loop?

If you are a programmer, you surely know what a loop is, and if not… Really?

When we are writing code, sometimes we need some block of code to be used more
than once, we could just write the same code over and over again but that's just
a waste of time, in those cases we use _a loop_, so basically, a loop only repeats
stuff. For example, if we want to display the numbers from one to ten, we could
do this:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`echo "1n";
echo "2n";
echo "3n";
echo "4n";
echo "5n";
echo "6n";
echo "7n";
echo "8n";
echo "9n";
echo "10n";`}
/>

Just so you know, _I wrote all that_, and it was tiring… Instead, I should have just done this:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`for ( $number = 1; $number <= 10; $number++ ) {
    echo $number . "n";
}`}
/>

So much easier. BTW I used a `for` loop, there are several types of loops. WordPress,
for instance, uses a `while` loop.

## What is “The Loop”?

Now we know what _a_ loop is, but what makes WordPress' loop so special that it
makes it _the_ loop? Well, without The Loop, WordPress wouldn't show us what we
want to see, that being **our posts**.

The Loop performs a ton of actions under the hood so that we only worry about
**how to display our posts, and not about how to retrieve our posts**. A very basic
loop (taken from Twentythirteen) looks like this:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
    <?php /* The loop */ ?>
    <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
        <?php get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); ?>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
    <?php twentythirteen_paging_nav(); ?>
<?php else : ?>
    <?php get_template_part( 'content', 'none' ); ?>
<?php endif; ?>`}
/>

Let's keep in mind that when we access any page in WordPress, there's a global
query taking place, that means **WordPress already knows which page we are visiting**
and there's already a `$wp_query` object with all the information we need, now let's
see what the loop does.

- `if ( have_posts() ):` First of all, this functions checks the $wp_query object
  and returns true if the object has posts in it.
- `while ( have_posts() ):` Now, **this is the real start of the loop**, as long as
  `have_posts()` is true, let's run the rest of the code inside.
- `the_post()`: Now that we are inside the loop, we need to populate our `$post`
  object, this function also fires `setup_postdata()` which checks for things like
  the number of pages inside the post.
- `get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() )`: Now, we have our $post
  object complete, it's time to show it to the world, we could just insert the markup
  and functions like `the_title()` and `the_content()` right here, but it's a good practice
  to keep things clean by including a template (I plan on talking about `get_template_part`
  in another post).
- `endwhile`: We already included the template to display the posts, so we can
  just **end the loop**, remember, as long as there are posts in the query, the loop
  will be in action.
- `twentythirteen_paging_nav()`: This function is specific to this theme,
  basically it just displays navigation links in case there's more posts in the page.
- `else`: If the query was empty, or if have_posts returned false, then we should
  let the user know by including a special template for these embarrassing situations.
- `endif`: Finish the if statement, **completely finish the loop**

## Using The Loop with custom queries

Usually we use The Loop along with the **main query**, or the `$wp_query` object, but
what happens if by any reason we need to use a custom query?

We could modify the query by using query_posts, but I don't recommend it because
it in fact modifies the main query, and it usually brings more problems than solutions,
the real solution is to just **create a new query**.

## The get_posts method

The function `get_posts` is a way to create **small custom loops**, it accepts all
the parameters of `WP_Query` and returns an array with the result, that way we
can use a `foreach` loop to work with the posts:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`$posts = get_posts( $args );
foreach ( $posts as $post ) :
    setup_postdata( $post );
?>
    <h2><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
    <?php the_content(); ?>
<?php
endforeach;
wp_reset_postdata();`}
/>{' '}

Notice how **we need to fire** `setup_postdata` manually? That is because we don't
use `the_post` in this loop.

## The “new query” method

In my personal experience, I have had issues when using get_posts in bigger loops,
that is why in those cases I prefer to use a new WP_Query. This creates a new
query **completely independent** of the main query, and we can use the WordPress loop
without any worries.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`$my_query = new WP_Query( $args );
if ( $my_query->have_posts() ):
    while ( $my_query->have_posts() ) : $my_query->the_post();
?>
        <h2><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
        <?php the_content(); ?>
<?php
    endwhile;
    wp_reset_postdata();
endif;
?>`}
/>

As you can see, it's pretty much the same loop as the one we use with the main
query, the difference being the constant use of `$my_query`, this is necessary
because the functions `have_posts` and `the_post` **are actually aliases** that point to
the `$wp_query` object, so when we call `have_posts` we are actually calling `$wp_query->have_posts`,
that's why **we need to specify** that we are calling the function in our new `$my_query` object.

## Outside The Loop

When reading tutorials and articles about WordPress, you often see the phrases
“inside the loop” or “outside the loop”, what do these mean?

**Inside the loop** must be pretty obvious right now, everything between the
`while` and `endwhile`, or `foreach` and `endforeach` tags is inside the loop, that means
it uses either the main query, or a custom query, and that our `$post` object is available.

**Outside the loop**, however, is everything outside those tags, it does not use
any query and the `$post` object is not available. How could that be useful?

Well, let's say you have a custom sidebar in your posts, this sidebar must display
a specific custom field called “mood” that belongs to the current post. But the
sidebar is **outside the loop**, how can I access the post data?

Before, when I said that `$post` is not available, I meant is **not automatically
available**, remember, **when we access any page in WordPress, there's a main query
taking place**. Even if we don't have a loop in the sidebar, _we do_ have a `$wp_query`
and a `$post` object _somewhere_, we just need to call them.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php
    global $post;
    $mood = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'mood', true );
?>
<p>I'm feeling <?php echo $mood; ?></p>`}
/>

Since `$post` is a **global variable**, that means it's always available for us to
use, we just need to know how to call it, just like an old partner.

## Conclusion

As you can see, **The Loop** is pretty easy to understand, and incredibly useful.
You can be sure that no matter what page of WordPress are you in, there's _always_
a loop in action. So I hope this small article helped you to understand a little
more about our friend The Loop.
