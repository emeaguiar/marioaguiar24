I have always said that you can do almost anything using WordPress thanks to all
the built-in functions and **APIs** that we have at our disposal. However, seems like
for some of them the documentation is still in early stages.

I have had the need to use these APIs in the past, but almost never I have **used
them all together**. So in hopes of learn a little bit more about them, I decided
to write a simple plugin using them, and document my progress in here.

I will write a simple download manager, called **Mah Download Manager** (patent pending!).
This plugin should help me **upload files, store them in the database**, and **display
a list of the saved data**.

In order to do this, we'll use three of the APIs in WordPress, **Filesystem, Database**
and **List Table**. So let's begin.

## Part I – Define the plugin and set up the upload function

This article is a bit advanced, so I assume you at least have some knowledge
about [writing a WordPress plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin),
that's why I won't get into specific details, let's just get started:

_mah-plugin-manager.php_

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Mah Download Manager
 * Plugin URI: https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-download-manager
 * Description: A simple download manager for WordPress
 * Version: 1.0
 * Author: Mario Aguiar
 * Author URI: https://www.marioaguiar.net
 * License: GPL2
 */
class Mah_Download_Manager {

    function __construct() {
        add_action( 'admin_menu', array( $this, 'register_menu_pages' ) );
    }

    function register_menu_pages() {
        add_menu_page( 'Mah Download manager', 'Downloads', 'manage_options', 'mah-download-manager', array( $this, 'display_menu_page' ), 'dashicons-download', 12 );
    }

    function display_menu_page() {

?>

“>

This space will display a list of files…

<?php
    }
}

$mah_download_manager = new Mah_Download_Manager;`}
/>

Here I'm defining a very basic structure, I **add the meta data of the plugin**, and 
**an admin page** where I will display a list of all our files later on. Right now 
is empty, so let's setup another page to **add the files** and then we'll come back to this one.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`add_submenu_page( 'mah-download-manager', __( 'Add new file', 'mah-download-manager' ), __( 'Add new file', 'mah-download-manager' ), 'upload_files', 'mah-download-manager/new', array( $this, 'display_add_new_page' ) );`}
/>

First, we create a new submenu page where we will put our **upload form**, this new 
page will only be visible to people who can upload files, and will display whatever 
we put on the `display_add_new_page` function.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function display_add_new_page() {
        if ( $this->form_is_submitted() ) {
            return;
        }
?>

                                            :                                 ” name=”mdm-upload”>

<?php
    }`}
/>

Simple form, we just added **one field to select our file**, a **submit button** and a 
**nonce field** to make sure we are submitting the form from the right place, we also 
check whether or not our form is being processed, in case it is, do not display 
the form. Since we are leaving our `action` attribute empty, the form will be processed 
in the same function, unless we perform this check.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function form_is_submitted() {
        if ( empty( $_POST ) ) {
            return false;
        }
        check_admin_referer( 'mah-download-manager' );

        $mdm_form_fields = array( 'mdm-file', 'mdm-upload' );
        $mdm_method = '';

        if ( isset( $_POST[ 'mdm-upload' ] ) ) {
            $url = wp_nonce_url( 'mah-download-manager/new', 'mah-download-manager' );
            if ( ! $creds = request_filesystem_credentials( $url, $mdm_method, false, false, $mdm_form_fields ) ) {
                return true;
            }

            if ( ! WP_Filesystem( $creds ) ) {
                request_filesystem_credentials( $url, $mdm_method, true, false, $mdm_form_fields );
                return true;
            }

            $fileTempData = $_FILES[ 'mdm-file' ];

            $this->upload_file( $fileTempData );
        }
        return true;
    }`}
/>

Now, if the form is empty, **we don't need to continue in this function**, so return 
`false`. `check_admin_referer` checks if the nonce field we added to the form is valid 
and if it is, **we are ready to perform our magic with the Filesystem API**.

First we make sure we have submitted the form by **checking the value of the upload 
button**, then we prepare a new nonce to go along our upload screen.

`request_filesystem_credentials` checks if we have the credentials to upload files 
depending on the method we use to perform the upload, in this case I left `$mdm_method` 
blank, WordPress by default will use **FTP access**. If we don't have the credentials 
WordPress will display another screen asking for them.

Once WordPress has confirmed **we can write in the server** we can save the file 
temporary data in a variable and then go to our upload function.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function upload_file( $file ) {
    $file = ( ! empty( $file ) ) ? $file : new WP_Error( 'empty_file', __( "Seems like you didn't upload a file.", 'mah-download-manager' ) );

    if ( is_wp_error( $file ) ) {
        wp_die( $file->get_error_message(), __( 'Error uploading the file.', 'mah-download-manager' ) );
    }

    $fileTempDir = $file[ 'tmp_name' ];
    $filename = trailingslashit( $this->uploadsDirectory[ 'path' ] ) . $file[ 'name' ];

    $response = $this->move_file( $fileTempDir, $filename );

    if ( is_wp_error( $response ) ) {
        wp_die( $response->get_error_message(), __( 'Error uploading the file.', 'mah-download-manager' ) );
    }

    wp_redirect( admin_url( 'admin.php?page=mah-download-manager&message=1' ) );
    exit;
}`}
/>

First I make sure our `$file` variable is not empty, if it is, something went wrong 
in the process and i use `WP_Error` to let the user know about the issue.

If there's no error I prepare the path where the file is going to be saved using 
`$this->uploadsDirectory[ 'path' ]` and our file's name and extension in `$file[ 'name' ]`.

Then we move our file to it's new **permanent location on the server**, and wait 
for the response, if the response of our next function is successful, we'll redirect 
the user back to the main screen and display him a success message, if not, we'll 
display another error.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function move_file( $from, $to ) {
    global $wp_filesystem;
    if ( $wp_filesystem->move( $from, $to ) ) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return WP_Error( 'moving_error', __( "Error trying to move the file to the new location.", 'mah-download-manager' ) );
    }
}`}
/>

This function is really simple, we just call the Filesystem API and **try to move 
the file**, if it works then return `true`, if it doesn't work return an error.

Remember how earlier I redirected the user along with a success message? When I  
registered the main page, you may have noticed I also added this line:

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php do_action( 'mdm_display_messages' ); ?>

`}
/>

This is what we know as a **hook**, or to be more accurate, this is the place where
our hook is going to be executed. The core of WordPress is filled with this beauties,
and yes, **we can create our own**, just like I did here. I created this so it's simpler
to add messages. Now let's hook something to it.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function display_messages() {
    if ( ! isset( $_GET[ 'message' ] || ! intval( $_GET[ 'message' ] ) ) ) {
        return;
    }

    $message = $_GET[ 'message' ];

    switch ( $message ) {
        case 1:
            $class = 'updated';
            $text = __( 'File uploaded succesfully.', 'mah-download-manager' );
            break;
    }

    echo '

‘ . $text . ‘

';
}`}
/>

And add the hook to the `__construct` function.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`add_action( 'mdm_display_messages', array( $this, 'display_messages' ) );
`}
/>

Now the page will check if a `$message` has been sent, if it has, then it will look
in the list for a match and then **it will display the message**.

### The road so far…

Check out the full source code on [my github](https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-download-manager/tree/filesystem).

Up until now we have a plugin that allows us to **upload and store files in the server**,
but that's it, we still need to keep track of those files, store their data and display
it to the user. First of all let's store the data in our database. Now, there's
some ways we could do that, but I think the most suitable way for this plugin is
**to create our own tables in the database**.

## Part II – Installing, uninstalling and storing data in the database

The best way to do this is by creating an **install function**, and hook it to the
plugin activation process, this hook looks a little different to the rest, but trust me,
it's the right one.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`register_activation_hook( __FILE__, array( $this, 'install' ) );
`}
/>

That will execute our `install()` method only when out plugin is activated, but
will execute it _every_ time our plugin is activated, so let's make sure we only
run the installation process if we haven't done it before, I like to do that by
adding a **database version** variable, that way it will still be useful in case we
need to upgrade it later on.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`
function __construct() {
    $this->mdb_db_version = 1;
...`}
/>

Now our install method.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function install() {
    $current_db_version = get_option( 'mdm_db_version' );
    if ( ! $current_db_version ) {
        global $wpdb;

        $table_name = $wpdb->prefix . "mah_download_manager";

        $charset_collate = '';

        if ( ! empty( $wpdb->charset ) ) {
            $charset_collate = "DEFAULT CHARACTER SET {$wpdb->charset}";
        }

        if ( ! empty( $wpdb->collate ) ) {
            $charset_collate .= " COLLATE {$wpdb->collate}";
        }

        $sql = "CREATE TABLE $table_name (
                    id mediumint(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                    date datetime DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00' NOT NULL,
                    name tinytext NOT NULL,
                    url varchar(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
                    UNIQUE KEY id (id)
                ) $charset_collate;";

        require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php';

        dbDelta( $sql );

        add_option( 'mdm_db_version', 1 );
    } elseif ( $current_db_version < $this->mdb_db_version ) {
        $this->upgrade( $current_db_version );
    }

}`}
/>

This function does several things, so let's break it down in steps:

1. We try to retrieve the database version number from the WordPress options,
   in case this is the first time we activate the plugin, **this won't exist**, which
   means we can install the plugin without any worries.
2. Then we call `$wpdb`, the **Database API**, and setup our table's basic structure.
   `$wpdb->prefix` is the prefix currently used by our installation, and is defined in the wp-config file.
3. After that we need to manually define our SQL query, with the fields that we
   will be needing, in this case I chose to store the **date, file name and url in
   the server**,
4. `dbDelta()` is the function we will use to execute this query, as is not
   loaded by default, **we need to include the upgrade functions** and run the query.
5. We set up an option in WordPress, this will store **the plugin's current version**,
   which will be checked next time the plugin is activated.
6. If the version option is present in WordPress, but it's different to the
   version we set in the plugin, this means **we need to upgrade our database**, so we
   run the upgrade script.

The upgrade script is empty as for now, but it will be useful in the future:

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`/**
 * Reserved for upgrading purposes
 */
function upgrade( $current ) {

}`}
/>

Don't forget, just like we create tables when installing the plugin, **we need to
delete them when we uninstall it**. This is important because we don't want to have
lingering options in the website.

_uninstall.php_

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php
    if ( !defined( 'WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN' ) )
        exit();

    $option_name = 'mdm_db_version';

    delete_option( $option_name );

    // For site options in multisite
    delete_site_option( $option_name );

    global $wpdb;

    $table_name = $wpdb->prefix . "mah_download_manager";

    $wpdb->query( "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {$table_name}" );`}

/>

We **remove the options** we added, and **drop the database tables** we created, let's
make sure everything is the way it was before we installed our plugin.

Now we need to change our uploading function, so **it stores data after a successful
upload**, we wait for that response and _then_ we redirect the user.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function upload_file( $file ) {
...
    $file_id = $this->store_data( $file );

    if ( $file_id ) {
        wp_redirect( admin_url( 'admin.php?page=mah-download-manager&message=1' ) );
        exit();
    } else {
        wp_die( 'There was an error saving the data to the database' );
    }

}`}
/>

Our store_data function looks like this:

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function store_data( $file ) {
    global $wpdb;

    $this->table_name = $wpdb->prefix . "mah_download_manager";

    $data = array(
        'name' => sanitize_file_name( $file[ 'name' ] ),
        'type' => sanitize_mime_type( $file[ 'type' ] ),
        'size' => intval( $file[ 'size' ] ),
        'url'  => trailingslashit( $this->uploadsDirectory[ 'url' ] ) . $file[ 'name' ],
        'path' => trailingslashit( $this->uploadsDirectory[ 'path' ] ) . sanitize_file_name( $file[ 'name' ] )
    );

    return $wpdb->insert( $this->table_name, $data );

}`}
/>

We set the table we are using to store the data, and we create the `$data` array
to define what data are we going to save in the database. **Do NOT forget to sanitize
the data**. WordPress already provides us with useful functions to make sure our
data is as safe as possible.

After all that, we run the query it will return the value of our `AUTO_INCREMENT`
field, in this case, the `id`. Or false if there's an error.

If everything went well we will be redirected to the main page of our plugin
with a success message, **and the data will be available in our database**.

### The road so far…

Check out the code so far on [github](https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-download-manager/tree/database).

Now we have a plugin that displays a form to upload files, saves them in our
server's uploads folder, and stores the file's data in a custom table inside our
database, cool huh? But we still need to **actually see that data in our plugin's page**,
now is only available if we see our uploads folder or we navigate directly to our
database, so let's move on.

## Part III – Displaying files data in the dashboard

I'm going to use yet another API to display all the records in the database, `WP_List_Table`.

You should notice that the use of this class **is not recommended** by the WordPress
team, as it's supposed to be internal use only and it may change at any time without
previous notice. _However_, at the time this article is being written, the class hasn't
had any major changes practically since it was written. Still, if you are paranoid,
it's safe to include a copy of the class in your plugin, I won't do that at this time.

First of all, we shouldn't access this class directly, **we need to extend it
using another class**. So we need a new file.

_class-mah-download-manager-list.php_

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php
    class Mah_Download_Manager_List extends WP_List_Table {

    }`}

/>

We need to overwrite a couple methods in here, starting with `prepare_items`,
because we need to have data to show.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function prepare_items() {
    global $wpdb;

    $table_name = $wpdb->prefix . "mah_download_manager";

    $per_page = $this->get_items_per_page( 'posts_per_page' );

    if ( isset( $_REQUEST[ 'number' ] ) ) {
        $number = (int) $_REQUEST[ 'number' ];
    } else {
        $number = $per_page + min( 8, $per_page );
    }

    if ( isset( $_REQUEST[ 'start' ] ) ) {
        $start = (int) $_REQUEST[ 'start' ];
    } else {
        $start = ( $page - 1 ) * $per_page;
    }

    $items = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $table_name ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT $start, $number" );

    $this->items = array_slice( $items, 0, $number );
    $this->extra_items = array_slice( $items, $number );

    $total = count( $items );

    $this->set_pagination_args( array(
        'total_items' => $total,
        'per_page' => $per_page
    ) );

    $this->_column_headers = array(
        $this->get_columns(),
        array(),
        $this->get_sortable_columns()
    );

}`}
/>

Ok so there are lots of things going on in here, let's break it down:

1. First **we call the database API** (like we did when we stored the data) and
   specify the table we'll be requesting the data from.
2. We set up the number of items we'll show on each page, `get_items_per_page` is
   a built-in method in the lists API, in this case it will return the same number
   we have stored on the `posts_per_page` option, which can be changed in the **“Reading”
   options** of the administration side.
3. Then we check in which page we are now, and set the limit and offset for our
   query, **this will only return the items we need**.
4. Now that we have defined the start and end of our query, it's time to run it with `get_results`.
5. We slice the result and store the items in the class' propertys, we also store
   the number of results. And set the pagination arguments with it.
6. Last but not least, we need to set the headers of our columns, `_column_headers`
   accepts an array, this must contain the **visible headers**, the **hidden headers**,
   and the sortable headers (in this case I won't add sortable properties, but it is required).

If we try to run the code now, we'll get an error message, that is because
`get_columns` is another method **we must define ourselves**, luckily, it is very simple.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function get_columns() {
    return array(
        'file' => __( 'File', 'mah_download_manager' ),
        'type' => __( 'Type', 'mah_download_manager' ),
        'size' => __( 'Size', 'mah_download_manager' ),
        'date' => __( 'Date Added', 'mah_download_manager' )
    );
}`}
/>

As you can see, we only need to return an array with the **names and ids of our headers**, no big deal.

Now, there's yet another method we need to define, the one that will display
the data of all those columns in the list. Actually, we have a choice to make
in here. We can create **one default method that handles everything**, or we can
create **multiple methods that handle a specific column**.

For the purposes of this article, I'll use both.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function column_default( $item, $column_name ) {
    switch ( $column_name ) {
        case 'file':
            echo '<a href="' . $item->url . '">' . $item->name . '</a>';
            break;
        default:
            echo $item->$column_name;
            break;
    }
}`}
/>

`column_default` will be called if **there's no other method** that handles a
specific column, how does WordPress find it? By using the syntax `column_$columnName`,
so if I want a specific method handling the `date` column, I do this:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function column_date( $item ) {
    $m_time = $item->date;
    $time = strtotime( $m_time );
    $time_diff = time() - $time;
    if ( $time_diff > 0 && $time_diff < 24*60*60 ) {
        $h_time = sprintf( __( '%s ago' ), human_time_diff( $time ) );
    } else {
        $h_time = mysql2date( __( 'Y/m/d' ), $m_time );
    }
    echo '<abbr title="' . $m_time . '">' . $h_time . '</abbr>';
}`}
/>

And that way `column_default` won't be called for the `date` column. By the way,
this is a simple function to make the date more readable, I just copied from
the WordPress core and adapted it a bit.

### The road so far…

Check out the code so far in [github](https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-download-manager/tree/list).

That's pretty much what we need to display our lists. So now we have a plugin
that **displays a form to upload files**, saves them to our server, **stores the data
in a custom table** and **displays the data** in our plugin's main page, the only thing
left to do would be to **delete those files** from our server and database, so let's go on.

## Part IV – Deleting files from our server and database

To delete files from our server, we first need to update our list with a **delete
link** on the files we have, to do that, we'll need to edit our `column_default`
method and call another method: `row_actions`.

_class-mah-download-manager-list.php_

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function column_default( $item, $column_name ) {
...
    case 'file':
...
        $actions = array(
            'delete' => '<a href="' . add_query_arg( array( 'action' => 'delete', 'file_id' => $item->id ) ) . '">' . __( 'Delete', 'mah_download_manager' ) . '</a>'
        );
        echo $this->row_actions( $actions );
...`}
/>

First we create an array with the actions we need, we need to give a name to our
action and define the text or markup that will be displayed. The `add_query_arg`
function returns the current URL and appends an array as parameters to send,
in this case I add the `delete` action with a `file_id` value, we'll use this to **find
the file in the database and remove it from the server**.

Now, what happens after the user clicks on that link? we can create a new page
to manage the downloads or we can do it in the same page we are in. Or better yet,
just **use a hook to look for the action inside this page**.

Every time we register a new page, WordPress **also registers a hook** that only works
on said page, the syntax is `toplevel_page_$menuslug`, in this case the slug is
`mah-download-manager` so we add the action:

_mah-download-manager.php_

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function __construct() {
...
    add_action( 'toplevel_page_mah-download-manager', array( $this, 'custom_action' ) );
...`}
/>

And we add the functionality:

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function custom_action() {
    if ( ! isset( $_GET[ 'action' ] ) ) {
        return;
    }

    if ( ! isset( $_GET[ 'file_id' ] ) ) {

Looks like there's a lot of code in here, but don't worry, most of it we've seen
before, so let me explain the steps we take:

1. First we **make sure there's an action defined**, if not simply stop running the code.
2. Then make sure **there's a file selected**, if not then there's no use in trying to do anything.
3. Then we check which action we are trying to run, if it's not in the list then stop everything. I wrote it this way thinking that in the future we might want to add more actions.
   - 1 Inside the `delete` action, we need to **make sure the user didn't just
     simply clicked by accident**, so we display a message asking if that's
     really what he wants to do.
   - Once we have confirmed that the user really wants to delete the file,
     **we need to activate the Filesystem API again**, and then call the new
     method `delete_file`.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`function delete_file( $id ) {
    global $wpdb, $wp_filesystem;
    $table_name = $wpdb->prefix . "mah_download_manager";

    $file_path = $wpdb->get_var( $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT path FROM $table_name WHERE id = %d", $id ) );

    $file_deleted = ( $wp_filesystem->delete( $file_path ) ) ? true : new WP_Error( 'delete_file_error', __( 'There was an error removing the file from the server. Check the path?', 'mah_download_manager' ) );

    $row_deleted = ( $wpdb->delete( $table_name, array( 'id' => $id ) ) ) ? true : new WP_Error( 'delete_row_error', __( 'There was an error removing the data from the database.', 'mah_download_manager' ) );

    if ( ! is_wp_error( $file_deleted ) && ! is_wp_error( $row_deleted ) ) {
        wp_redirect( admin_url( 'admin.php?page=mah-download-manager&message=2' ) );
        exit;
    } else {
        wp_die( __( 'There were errors while deleting the file.', 'mah_download_manager' ) );
    }

}`}
/>

This method **will remove the file from the server and remove the data from our database**, here's the breakdown:

1. First we call the APIs `$wpdb` to manage the database and `$wp_filesystem` to manage
   the files (this one is only available after activating it previously).
2. Then we retrieve the file's path from the database, remember to do this _before_ deleting the data!
3. Now that we have the path, **we remove the file from the server**, and check for any errors along the way.
4. After deleting the file, **it's safe to remove the data from the database**, once again, check for errors.
5. If there were no errors while deleting the data, then let's **redirect the user back to the main page**, and add a new message.

Now let's go back to `display_messages` and add the new message:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function display_messages() {
...
    case 2:
        $class = 'updated';
        $text = __( 'The selected file has been removed.', 'mah-download-manager' );
        break;
...`}
/>{' '}

### The end of the road…

Check out the final code in [github](https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-download-manager).

This has been a fun trip! Now we are pretty much done with our plugin, here's the list of features:

- Upload and store files using **WordPress' Filesystem API**.
- Create and manage data in the database using **WordPress' Database API**.
- Display a list of the content using **WordPress' Lists API**.
- Delete existing files from the database and server using **Database and Filesystem APIs**.

Pretty cool huh? We just created a functional plugin that relies mostly in APIs
that are in the core of WordPress, this means that **if WordPress works in your server,
it's a pretty safe bet to say that this plugin will also work for you**.
