  In this post I will explain and share a small script that will allow us to
  calculate
    the average reading time of any text in JavaScript.

One of the most used functions these days is the **calculation of reading time**.
I even use it on this blog.

Why? It's simply a quick way to tell the user _how much time they can spend on the article_,
maybe it's very fast (like this one) or maybe it takes a little longer.

Here I will show you a quick trick to get it:

## The code

First of all, I will show you **the code I use** for this functionality,
and then I will explain it:

```ts
/**
 * Calculate the average reading time of a text
 */
function readingTime(text: string): number {
  const WORDS_PER_MINUTE: number = 225;
  const words: number = text.trim().split(/\s+/).length;

  return Math.ceil(words / WORDS_PER_MINUTE);
}
```

## The explanation

As you can see, it's a pretty simple piece of code, basically what we do is:

- We define a constant `WORDS_PER_MINUTE` that will give us a base for our calculation,
  normally _ranges between 150 and 300_ (words per minute) depending on the level and age of the person, so **we will use 225**[^1]
- `text.trim()` removes the spaces at the beginning and end of the text, so that
  **always starts and ends with a letter, number, or symbol**
- `.split(/\s+/)` “cuts” all the text at each space and stores it in an `array`
- `.length` returns **the total number of elements in the array**, our number of words
- `Math` is the JavaScript library that provides functions for calculations
- `.ceil` is a **rounding function**, it means that it will round _up_
  to the nearest whole number (for example 52.2 will become 53)[^2]
- Finally, **we divide our total words by our constant of
  words per minute** (`words / WORDS_PER_MINUTE`), and we will have as a result
  the number of minutes it would take an average person to read the text

That's it! If we want to go a step further we can **convert it to hours** or save it
in seconds to have better control, but basically this is all we need.

## Avobe and Beyond

As you can see the function takes a text to calculate the time, if we want to make it a little more
_automatic_ we can make it take the text from an HTML element, or from a file, or from any other
source we can think of.

For example:

```ts
const text = document.querySelector('.article').innerText; // It is important to use \`innerText\`;

readingTime(text);
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Why do we use `innerText` instead of `innerHTML`?**
>
> Because `innerText` returns the text _without tags_,
> while `innerHTML` returns the text _with tags_.
>
> If we use `innerHTML` we would be counting the tags as words,
> which is not what we want.

I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me, greetings!
