Even though it is a somewhat old tool, for more than 10 years _SASS_ has been one
of my best friends in web development, it remains extremely powerful even with the
numerous advances in CSS in recent years, because it still has several tools that
CSS does not, and they are still useful, such as **the ability to use arrays in sass**.

One of the most used examples of these tools is the **ability to use arrays in sass**. This allows us to _create loops, maps_, etc. This way we can share information between our files and even save several lines of code.

In SASS, arrays are known as **lists**, in their most basic version, a list is declared
as follows:

```scss
$colors: yellow, blue, red, green;
```

This way, we can access any element in the array with the `nth` function:

```scss
$colors: yellow, blue, red, green;
@debug nth($colors, 2);
// style.scss:3 Debug: blue
```

## Uses

Now that we have our list declared, we can start using it as it should, the most
common use I have found is the printing of utility classes, such as when creating
a loop with `@each`:

```scss
$colors: yellow, blue, red, green;
@each $color in $colors {
  .text-#{$color} {
    color: $color;
  }
}
// Output:
.text-yellow {
  color: yellow;
}
.text-blue {
  color: blue;
}
.text-red {
  color: red;
}
.text-green {
  color: green;
}
```

>
> `.text-#{$color} // .text-yellow` > `.text-$color // .text-$color`
>
> On the other hand, when using variables as the value of the property, this is not
> necessary unless we also mix it with regular text, if not, SASS will do it automatically.

## Expanding

Ready! That is a simple way to create and use arrays (or lists) in SASS, as you can
see it is very simple, but now what's next? What other uses do you think can be
given to it? Do not hesitate to contact me for any questions or leave a comment
with other uses that can be given to it. See you!
