# Create a Dark Mode Button in React with Tailwind

During the redesign of the blog, I was surprised at how easy it was to add a dark
mode in _Tailwind_, so I thought why not add a small button that could change it
at will (nothing fancy), and since I was going to do that, I also thought about
recording the process ðŸ™‚.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to **create a simple dark mode button in our
React application with Tailwind CSS**.

## Acceptance criteria

As always, before we start, let's define the acceptance criteria for this feature:

- [ ] Create an application with dark mode
- [ ] Add a button to manually change the application mode
- [ ] The mode should change automatically if the user has dark mode set on their 
operating system settings

I think that's enough, now let's get to work!

## Prerequisites

I lied ðŸ™ˆ, before we start... This tutorial assumes that you have intermediate
React knowledge (or basic if think so). Also, you'll need a React
application.

If you don't have one yet, I suggest using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). You
can find more information in the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite).

It's pretty simple and the assistant will help you through the process, now, let's
get to work! (for real this time).

## Step 1: Create the dark mode

First of all, we need our application to have a **dark mode** to switch to, for
practical purposes of this tutorial, we'll create a very basic site using Tailwind.
For example, this simple application:

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`<main>
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center px-4">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-8">Hello, world!</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">Wlcome to my website!</p>
    </div>
</main>`}
/>

### Step 1.1: Create the "light mode"

The magic of Tailwind (or misfortune, depending on who you ask) is that you can
add all the styles you need through _utility classes_,[^1] so to shape our site,
we simply add the colors we need in the form of `bg-` and `text-` classes:

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`<main>
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-4 bg-yellow-100 text-slate-900">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 text-red-700">Hello, world!</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">Welcome to my website!</p>
    </div>
</main>`}
/>

Would give us something like this:

<AlignWide>
    <LightExample />
</AlignWide>

> [!TIP]
> You can find more information about Tailwind colors in the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).
> Or you can extend the color palette with [your own configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#extending-the-defaults).

Now this type of pattern is... _controversial_ in the web development community, but
for practical reasons and for the purposes of this tutorial, it serves us very well.
The advantage of this approach is that we can change the colors of our application
without having to modify the source code, simply by changing the CSS classes. This
**gives us greater development speed**, but it can become complicated to maintain in
larger applications.

### Step 1.2: Create the "dark mode"

Once we have an idea of how we want our site to look during the day, we can start
playing with the dark mode, for this (and because we use Tailwind), we simply add
the color classes we need for the dark mode with the `dark:` prefix.

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`<main>
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-4 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-orange-950 text-slate-900 dark:text-yellow-50">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 text-red-700 dark:text-red-200">Hello, world!</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">Welcome to my website!</p>
    </div>
</main>`}
/>

Easy, isn't it? Well, that's it! What Tailwind does behind the scenes is to look
for the _user's preference_, and if they have dark mode set on their operating system,
it will automatically apply the `dark:` classes to the elements that have that class.
So, what we would normally do like this:

<Code
    language="css"
    children={`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    :root {
        --color--foreground: #431407; /* bg-orange-950 */
        --color--background: #fefce8; /* text-yellow-50 */
    }
}`}
/>

Now we simply do it like this:

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`<div className="dark:bg-orange-950 dark:text-yellow-50">Hello, world!</div>`}
/>

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the `dark` prefix, Tailwind also offers the `hover:`, `::after`, `lg:`,
> [among others](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).

And once the user's preferences change, Tailwind will take care of changing the colors
automatically:

<AlignWide>
    <DarkExample />
</AlignWide>

## Step 2: Add a button that changes the mode

So far we have a website that changes from light to dark depending on the user's
operating system preferences, but **what if the user wants to change it manually?**
For that we need a button.

### Step 2.1: Creating the button

Since we continue to use Tailwind, we can quickly add a button with the `bg-`, `text-`,
`rounded`, `p-` classes.

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`<button aria-label="Switch to dark mode" className="bg-yellow-800 text-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-100 dark:text-slate-900 rounded-full p-2 w-min">
    <SunIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
</button>`}
/>

And we'll end up with something like this:

<AlignWide className="flex justify-center">
    <SunButtonExample />
</AlignWide>

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure the button has an `aria-label` to make it accessible.

> [!CAUTION]
> Remember what I said about _utility classes_? Well, here is where it starts
> to get complicated, if you notice the `className` attribute of the button is a bit
> long, and if we need to change the background color, **we would have to change it in
> two places**, which can be a bit tedious. To avoid this, you can create your own
> reusable components.

And with the classes we just added, the button will change like this:

<AlignWide className="flex justify-center">
    <SunButtonDarkExample />
</AlignWide>

### Step 2.2: Putting the styles together

Now that we have our component and our button, **we need to put them together**,
for this, I won't explain all the classes, but basically we need an extra container
and add the button to our component.

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`<main>
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-8 bg-yellow-100 text-slate-900">
        <div className="flex justify-end w-full">
            <button aria-label="Switch to dark mode" className="bg-yellow-800 text-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-100 dark:text-slate-900 rounded-full p-2 w-min">
                <SunIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
            </button>
        </div>

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-red-700">Hello, world!</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">Welcome to my website!</p>
    </div>
</main>`}
/>

And with that, we'll have our result:

<AlignWide>
    <ComponentWithButton />
</AlignWide>

## Step 3: Switching the mode

So far our component will change color automatically depending on the user's operating
system preferences, but now we need our button to **manually trigger the change**.
In React, we can use `useState` to handle the state of our component.

<Code
    language="tsx"
    children={`import { useState } from 'react';

export function Component() {
    const [ isDarkModeActivated, setIsDarkModeActivated ] = useState( false );

    const toggleDarkMode = () => {
        setIsDarkModeActivated( !isDarkModeActivated );
    };

    return (
        <main>
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-4 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-orange-950 text-slate-900 dark:text-yellow-50">
                <div className="flex justify-end w-full">
                    <button
                        aria-label="Switch to dark mode"
                        className="bg-yellow-800 text-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-100 dark:text-slate-900 rounded-full p-2 w-min"
                        onClick={ toggleDarkMode }
                    >
                        <SunIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
                    </button>
                </div>

                <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 text-red-700 dark:text-red-200">Hello, world!</h1>
                <p className="text-lg mt-4">Welcome to my website!</p>
            </div>
        </main>
    );
}`}
/>

With that, by clicking our button, the state of `isDarkModeActivated` will change
(it will be toggled between `true` and `false`).

Tailwind offers another way to activate dark mode, so that it does not only depend
on the operating system preferences, but also by adding a `dark` class to the `html`,
however this must be activated in the Tailwind configuration file: `tailwind.config.ts`.

<Code
    language="ts"
    children={`import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
    darkMode: 'selector',
};

export default config;`}
/>

> [!NOTE]
> The official documentation indicates that the `dark` class must be added to the `<html>`
> for it to work correctly. However, I realized that it only needs to be in the parent
> element of the component we want to change. Normally we want the whole site to change,
> so we add it to the `<html>`. Here we simply add it to the main container.

And if we now add the `dark` class to the main container, our component will magically
change color:

<AlignWide className="dark">
    <ComponentWithButton />
</AlignWide>

### Step 3.1: Plugging in the button

When we click the button, the state of our application changes, but **how do we make
our component change color?** For this, we simply need to add the `dark` class to the
main container if `isDarkModeActivated` is `true`.

<Code
    language="tsx"
    children={`import { useState } from 'react';

export function Component() {
    const [ isDarkModeActivated, setIsDarkModeActivated ] = useState( false );

    const toggleDarkMode = () => {
        setIsDarkModeActivated( !isDarkModeActivated );
    };

    return (
        <main className={ isDarkModeActivated ? 'dark' : '' }>
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-4 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-orange-950 text-slate-900 dark:text-yellow-50">
                <div className="flex justify-end w-full">
                    <button
                        aria-label="Switch to dark mode"
                        className="bg-yellow-800 text-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-100 dark:text-slate-900 rounded-full p-2 w-min"
                        onClick={ toggleDarkMode }
                    >
                        <SunIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
                    </button>
                </div>

                <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 text-red-700 dark:text-red-200">Hello, world!</h1>
                <p className="text-lg mt-4">Welcome to my website!</p>
            </div>
        </main>
    );
}`}
/>

And with that, by clicking the button, the **color of our component will change**,

<AlignWide>
    <Component />
</AlignWide>

### Step 3.2: Maintaining operating system preferences

There is a small detail that comes with this implementation, and that is that when we
select the `selector` dark mode as we did above, Tailwind will not take care of
changing the color of our component if the user changes the system preferences, this
fortunately is easy to solve, we simply add the _media query_ within the Tailwind
configuration file. Like this:

<Code
    language="ts"
    children={`import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
    darkMode: [ 'variant', [
        '&.is(.dark *)',
        'media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { & * }',
    ],
};

export default config;`}
/>

> [!NOTE]
> The way this works is thanks to the magic of `&`, which refers to the current selector,
> in this case `html`, and `*` which refers to all elements within `html`. So, what we are
> saying is:
>
> - If the current selector (`html`) has the class `dark`, then apply the styles to all children.
> - If the operating system has dark mode set, then apply the styles to all children of `html`.

And with that, Tailwind will take care of changing the color of our component if the user
changes the preferences of their operating system.

## Next steps

And with that, we have finished, to recap, let's see the requirements we had:

- [x] Create an application with dark mode
- [x] Add a button to manually change the application mode
- [x] The mode should change automatically if the user has dark mode set on their

We have checked all the requirements, however in my opinion **there is still a lot
that can be done to improve our button**, which you could try (or I'll leave it for
another tutorial), for example:

- Add an animation to the button
- Change the button icon depending on the state of dark mode
- Add a _tooltip_ to the button
- Save the user's manual preference in the `localStorage`

And many other things, but for now, I think that's enough. If you have any questions
