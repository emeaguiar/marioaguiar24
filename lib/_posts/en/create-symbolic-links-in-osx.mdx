Symbolic links, or symlinks as they are also known. They can be seen as an alias, 
they are nothing more than "symbolic" paths that can point to any location on 
your computer, they are useful when you want to keep directories separate, but 
at the same time one inside the other. For example, if I have a repository 
with these files:

<Code
    language="plain"
    children={`- public
-- wp-content
-- .gitignore
-- composer.json
-- README.md`}
/>

And I want the `wp-content` directory, within an installation with existing files:

<Code
    language="plain"
    children={`- public
-- wp-admin
-- wp-includes
-- wp-config.php
...`}
/>

I couldn't just clone the repository, since the directory wouldn't be empty,
then, the solution would be to create a symbolic path with the `ln` command.
Its syntax is as follows:

<Code
    language="bash"
    children={`ln -s path/original path/symbolic
`}
/>

The `-s` parameter is what specifies that it is a symbolic link, in most cases
you won't need anything else. Now my installation would look like this:

<Code
    language="plain"
    children={`- public
-- wp-admin
-- wp-content
-- wp-includes
-- wp-config.php
...`}
/>

Where `wp-content` is a **reference to the original path**, and by entering that
directory I will simply enter the original, so every time I update the
repository I will get the updates also in my installation.
