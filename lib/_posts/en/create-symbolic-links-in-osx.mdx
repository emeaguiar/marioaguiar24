  Symbolic links, or symlinks as they are also known. They can be seen as an
  alias, they are nothing more than "symbolic" paths that can point to any
  location on your computer, they are useful when you want to keep directories
  separate, but at the same time one inside the other. For example, if I have a

Symbolic links, or symlinks as they are also known. They can be seen as an alias,
they are nothing more than "symbolic" paths that can point to any location on
your computer, they are useful when you want to keep directories separate, but
at the same time one inside the other. For example, if I have a repository
with these files:

```plain
- public
-- wp-content
-- .gitignore
-- composer.json
-- README.md
```

And I want the `wp-content` directory, within an installation with existing files:

```plain
- public
-- wp-admin
-- wp-includes
-- wp-config.php
...
```

I couldn't just clone the repository, since the directory wouldn't be empty,
then, the solution would be to create a symbolic path with the `ln` command.
Its syntax is as follows:

```bash
ln -s path/original path/symbolic
```

The `-s` parameter is what specifies that it is a symbolic link, in most cases
you won't need anything else. Now my installation would look like this:

```plain
- public
-- wp-admin
-- wp-content
-- wp-includes
-- wp-config.php
...
```

Where `wp-content` is a **reference to the original path**, and by entering that
directory I will simply enter the original, so every time I update the
repository I will get the updates also in my installation.
