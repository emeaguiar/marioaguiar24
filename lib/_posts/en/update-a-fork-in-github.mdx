When I am contributing either to the **core of WordPress** or to another Github
project, I like to create my own repository to avoid problems in the original.

The problem is that many times the original repository is updated before I finish
my work, creating some conflicts in the pull request, as this does not exist in my
fork, I always find myself looking for a way to **update my fork with the work of
the main repository**.

This is the easiest way I have found:

**Step 1**: We add a new `remote` with the original repository
(it can be called whatever we want, usually “upstream”)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/usuario/repo-original.git
```

**STep 2**: We `fetch` the changes from the original repository
(not `pull`, we don't want to `merge` yet)

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

**Step 3**: We do a `rebase` to replace the master of our repository,
with the original one

```bash
git rebase upstream/master`}
```

**Step 4**: We `push` to have the updated master in our repo

```bash
git push origin master
```

Now we can `merge` the new master into our branch to resolve conflicts.
