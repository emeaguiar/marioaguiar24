Hard times are what we are currently living, with a quarantine that we still do 
not see a clear end to. There is no doubt that the world will be different once this ends. 
Yes, because this will end.

One of the things I am sure will change drastically will be the way we interact
with our clients/bosses/collaborators. Not being able to leave home many of us are 
finally experiencing the wonders and challenges of **working outside a formal office**.

That's why I've decided to take a little boredom off and write some **advice I've
learned over five years of remote work**.

## 1. Keyword: "Work"

One of the biggest problems I had at the beginning of my remote adventure was:
**the lack of supervision, and almost no discipline**. I must be honest, the excess of freedom,
the extremely flexible schedules, and the fact that I only needed my
computer and an Internet connection **made my productivity drop
considerably**; "I still have time", "I'll do it at night", and many more excuses
with which I deceived myself almost got me into a **huge** problem.

The solution was to do everything I could to mentally prepare myself that yes, I am at
home, but I am WORKING. **I'm not resting**, I'm not paid to be lying down.
And I had to learn to discipline myself.

## 2. Business in the front, party in the back

![I want my mullet back…](/posts/work-from-home-advice/mullet.webp)

When you work from home there can be two big dangers:

1. You work very little
2. You work too much

Both have been my case, the problem is that, **either you get distracted and work very little because
you're at home. Or you focus too much because you're at home**. Let me expand
on this, as you only need your laptop, you can work from:

- Your study
- Your room
- Your living room 
- Your dining room
- Your kitchen
- Your garden
- Your bathroom
- ... You get the idea

Not having a clear definition of **when to enter, and when to leave** work mode
can dangerously lead us to _burnout_, and believe me, it's not a place you want to be.

The solution is quite simple, define zones within your home where you can work,
**and only work**. Just as you should define zones where you can rest, **and only rest**.
I recommend not mixing them, at least until we get used to going up and down
our work/rest switch. For example: I set up a room in my house to be my office,
I go in almost every day to work, **and I do nothing else**.
Once my workday is over, I leave there, **and I don't go back until I want
to work again**. Over time, my laptop became that switch, and now
I practically only use it for work.

You don't need a complete office, you can choose just a desk, the important thing is that
every time you approach it, **it's with the mindset of working**.

## 3. Choose your hours wisely

As I mentioned earlier, when I started in this world one of my biggest
problems was the excess of freedom, and the lack of discipline. The dark side
of flexible hours seduced me and I decided to take a break between work, and
the plan was simple: I would work **4 hours in the morning, and 4 hours at night**.

The result? **I worked 4 hours a day...**

![Me, working, December 2014](/posts/work-from-home-advice/resting.webp)

It turns out that a life of getting up early, going to school (and then to work),
to then return home with the sole idea of resting, had conditioned me to... rest.
I never went back to work in the evening, and **it began to show**.

After a very uncomfortable meeting with my _managers_ of the moment, I decided that if I wanted
to keep this beautiful lifestyle I had achieved, things needed to change. I found that since
my mornings were my most productive hours (and the only ones), I would extend them. **I work from nine to five, and only from nine to five**.

Once my workday is over, **I forget about everything, and I don't go back until the next day**.
This is a good balance for me, which allows me to make a complete change in my
work/rest mentality.

## Some more advice

### Dress for success

Yes, working in boxers, or in pajamas seems very attractive, and can work for
some. But remember, the point here is **to maintain the work mentality**.
Put on pants, maybe you can even shower...

### Let the other people in your house know

Video conferences are very common in remote work, and we all have a story that involves an important call,
and someone opening the door behind us doing (or wearing...) something **quite embarrassing**. ALL OF US.

### Don't be a hermit

For those of us who live alone, remote work can be a lonely thing.
Spending the day at home working, to then spend the afternoon at home resting
is not exactly a good way to socialize, and **we all need someone from time to time**. 
Luckily we live in a world where we don't even need to be on the same continent 
to be able to chat. _Slack, WhatsApp, Facebook, parties on Zoom, Instagram_, etc… 
There are many ways to **keep in touch with our friends**, there is nothing wrong 
with using them.

### Decorate your life

Working from home means **spending most of our time at home**, it doesn't hurt 
to have a decoration that helps us like to spend our time there. Pictures, ornaments, 
portraits, whatever doesn't make us think that **we are in another jail**.

## Conclusion

**Remote work**, or the _home office_, can be a blessing or a nightmare, it is
definitely not for everyone, as many of us learned the hard way. But I hope these
tips help the next generations not to make my mistakes and **start this beautiful
adventure on the right foot**. Good luck!
