This year I celebrate **10 years working with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) professionally, full
time**. This means that it is the platform that I get paid to work with (since technically I have been
working with it for about 15 years). And although it is not the only platform I have worked with, it is
the one I have spent the most time with throughout my career, and it holds a very special place in my
heart for everything I have learned and what it has allowed me to do.

That is why I am surprised that I have not created a post about **what WordPress is, what it is for, how
it works**, and other questions that I have been asked (and have asked) over the years. So here I am,
sharing a little of my knowledge and experience with this platform.

Let's start with the first one:

## What is WordPress?

![WordPress Logo](/posts/what-is-wordpress/WordPress-logotype-alternative.jpeg)

In a nutshell, **WordPress is a content management system (CMS[^1])**. That is, it is a _software_ that
allows us to create, edit, and manage content on a website without the need to know how to program.

This is useful for people who do not have technical knowledge, but who **want to have a website**, which
is why WordPress originally gained its popularity. Being used mainly in the blog boom, it allowed many
people to _have their own space on the internet without having to create it from scratch_.

## What is WordPress for?

I previously mentioned that WordPress gained its popularity in the blog boom, so for a long time it was
considered a platform _only for blogs_. However, over time and updates, WordPress has evolved to be a
_platform more versatile_. Today (and for many years) I maintain that you can do practically whatever you
want in WordPress.

Some of the projects I have personally worked on include:

- **Online stores** (one of the most popular uses of WordPress)
- Webcomic archives
- Art galleries
- **News sites / newspapers / magazines** (another of the most popular)
- Educational sites
- School yearbooks
- Room service / hotel screens
- Forums / Online communities

As you can see, the uses are incredibly varied, these are **just some of the ones I have worked on
personally in 10 years**. Imagine all those that I have not even considered.

## The history

According to the [official WordPress site](https://wordpress.org/about/), **WordPress began in 2003**
when Mike Little and [Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt) created a _fork_ of [b2](https://cafelog.com/)
looking for a way to **improve its code, create a simpler installation** (in those days, there were no
"installers" online, and we had to have at least minimal knowledge of databases, FTP, and PHP to install
it), and simply make it _user-friendly_.

Over time, WordPress continued to grow and evolve until today, when **WordPress is used on 43% of the sites
on the internet**[^2] (!).

## How does WordPress work?

WordPress works through a system of _themes_ and _plugins_. Themes are responsible for **how your website
looks**, while plugins are responsible for **what your website can do**.

For example, if you want your website to look like a blog, you can **install a blog theme**. If you want
your website to have an _online store_, you can **install an online store plugin**.

In this way, you can have the functionality of your site **separated from its appearance**, and you can
modify either of them _without having to redesign your entire site_ every time you add a new functionality.
Or _without having to recreate important pieces of your site_ every time you decide to change themes.

## Full Site Editing

In recent years, WordPress has been working on a new way to edit your website, called **Full Site Editing**.
With this new way of editing your website, you can modify **any part of your website** without the need to
know code. This is an incredibly big step for WordPress, as previously you needed to know code to modify
important parts of your website. At the same time, it is the culmination of the original idea that was had
when creating it, and it is to make things more user-friendly.

## Conclusion

WordPress is an incredibly versatile platform that has evolved a lot since its inception. Today it is used
on a large number of websites (almost half of the web), and is one of the most popular platforms on the
internet. If you are looking for a platform for your website, I recommend that you consider WordPress, as
it is a platform that will allow you to do practically **whatever you want**.

Until next time!
