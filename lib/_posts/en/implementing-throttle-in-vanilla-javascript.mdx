Hi, welcome to this video tutorial, this time I will be showing how to create a 
simple throttle function using only Vanilla JavaScript.

## What is Vanilla JavaScript?

Vanilla JavaScript, or Vanilla JS is nothing more than simple and pure JavaScript,
that's what we call it when we don't use libraries like Underscore, or frameworks
like React.

## What is “throttle”?

I assume that if you are watching this tutorial you already know what it means,
or at least you have an idea, so I won't delve much into the subject, but I will
leave an article that explains it in the references section in the description
and post that accompany this video.

Basically throttle is known as the practice where a function is executed only once
during a certain interval of time. For example, the user clicks a button that
executes a function, the function is executed once.

### What would happen if the user clicks a hundred times on the same button?

**A**: _The function would be executed a hundred times, bad for performance_.

Let's consider that we have HTML code, in which this button is included:

<Code
    language="js"
    children={`<button id="js-say-hello">Say Hello</button>
`}
/>

And we anchor an event like this, which logs “Hello world!” in the console:

<Code
    language="js"
    children={`const button = document.querySelector( '#js-say-hello' );
const sayHello = () => {
    console.log( 'Hello World!' );
}
if ( button ) {
    button.addEventListener( 'click', sayHello );
}`}
/>

If we open this code in the browser, we can see that each time we click, a new
entry is recorded in the console.

To avoid this, we define a time interval (for example one second) during which
no matter how many clicks the user gives, the function will be executed only once.
Once this interval ends, we can execute it only once more during another second,
and so on. It will only be executed once per second.

## How is throttle implemented?

In the following example we will implement a simple version of Throttle, taking
as reference the previous code, we will implement the following:

<Code
    language="js"
    children={`const throttle = ( callback, delay ) => {
    // We start a variable to know when the function was last called
    let lastCalled = 0;
    return ( ...args ) => {
        // We save a reference to this moment.
        const now = new Date().getTime();
        // We check if the defined delay time has passed
        if ( delay > ( now - lastCalled ) ) {
            return;
        }
        // We save this moment as the last time the function was called
        lastCalled = now;
        // We execute the function
        return callback( ...args );
    }
}
export default throttle;`}
/>

Now, since we have implemented our function, all we have to do is replace in our
original code, the call to the function by wrapping it in our Throttle.

<Code
    language="js"
    children={`// Import our function
import throttle from './throttle.js';
const button = document.querySelector( '#js-say-hello' );
// Wrap our message in a new function
const printMessage = () => {
    console.log( 'Hello World!' );
}
// Run Throttle
const sayHello = throttle( printMessage, 1000 );
if ( button ) {
    button.addEventListener( 'click', sayHello );
}`}
/>

Now, when we click on our button, we can see that no matter how many times we click,
it will only be executed once per second, if we increase the delay time, we can
see a clearer example, this time I am using three seconds:

## Additional notes

A very important point that we must take into account is that when using this method,
the clicks are not added to a queue, this means that they are not saved to be executed
later, simply if you click while the established time has not passed, that click
would be lost.

You can see this code working on Codepen (it is recommended to open the link to
see the console).

<Codepen
    user="emeaguiar"
    hash="oNWaOWg"
    loading={ () => <div>Loading...</div> }
/>
