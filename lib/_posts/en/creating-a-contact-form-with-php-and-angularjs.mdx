[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) seems to be the sensation these days, that's why I decided to try and
learn the basics of it. In fact, this very website is built using AngularJS, however,
I did find a couple of issues while working with it, nothing serious, but one of
them that surprised me was the **contact form**, since it took me a while to get the
hang of it, I decided to share what I learned with a small tutorial.

## The markup

For this tutorial I'm going to use a very basic setup, just a couple fields and
a submit button, so lets get started.

```jsx
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <title>Contact Form using AngularJS :: Mario Aguiar demo</title>
    </head>
    <body>
       
                            Contact                                    
                        Name:                                            
                   
                        Email:                                            
                   
                        Message:                                            
                   
                        I promise I'm not a bot                                            
                </fieldset>                 <button type=‚Äùsubmit‚Äù name=‚Äùsubmit‚Äù value=‚Äùsubmit‚Äù>Submit</button>             </form>         </div>     </body> </html>
```

Alright, I'd say that's pretty simple, we have a form, with three input fields,
**name, email, and message**, we also have a fourth field used only to catch spam bots,
this will be hidden from our human visitors and in fact we need it to be empty,
we'll hide it using css.

### The jQuery way

Before I start with AngularJS, let's have a look at how we would do this using
jQuery, like in the good old days:

```js
(function($) {
  var contactForm = {
    $form: $( 'form' ),
    init: function() {
      this.$form.on( 'submit', this.validateForm );
    },
    validateField: function( $field ) {
      if ( $field.val() === '' ) {
        return false;
      }
      if ( $field.attr( 'type' ) === 'email' ) {
        var emailRegex = /^w+@[a-zA-Z_]+?.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}$/;
        if ( ! emailRegex.test( $field.val() ) ) {
          return false;
        }
      }
      return true;
    },
    validateForm: function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      var $form = $(this);
      var fields = $form.find( 'input, textarea' ),
          hasError = false;
      fields.each(function() {
        var $field = $(this);
        if ( $field.attr('required') ) {
          if ( ! contactForm.validateField( $field ) ) {
            console.log('error');
            hasError = true;
          }
        }
      });
      if ( ! hasError ) {
        contactForm.processForm( $form );
      } else {
        contactForm.errorFn();
      }
    },
    processForm: function( $form ) {
      var formData = $form.serialize();
      $.ajax({
        url: 'processForm.php',
        type: 'POST',
        dataType: 'json',
        data: formData + '&submit=' + $form.find('button').val(),
      })
      .done( contactForm.successFn )
      .fail( contactForm.errorFn );
    },
    successFn: function(data) {
      if ( data.success === true ) {
        contactForm.$form.prepend('<p>Thanks for getting in touch!</p>');
      } else {
        contactForm.errorFn();
      }
    },
    errorFn: function() {
      contactForm.$form.prepend('<p>Something wrong happened!, please try again.</p>');
    }
  }
  contactForm.init();
})(jQuery);
```

I set up some basic code, we select the form, add a callback to the submit process,
validate the fields, make the AJAX request and wait for the result, however simple it is,
it **takes a few lines of code**.

Now let's see how we could achieve the same using AngularJS.

### The AngularJS way

First of all, one of the things I like the most about Angular is **the way it
integrates with our html code**, did you notice how when using jQuery we did almost
everything in our js file? the html code remained pretty much unchanged.

AngularJS requires a bit more configuration on the markup side, so let's change
it to this:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="contact">
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <title>Contact Form using AngularJS :: Mario Aguiar demo</title>
    </head>
    <body>
       
                           
Thanks for getting in touch!

Something wrong happened!, please try again.

                Contact
                        Name:

                        Email:

                        Message:

                        I promise I'm not a bot
                </fieldset>                 <button type=‚Äùsubmit‚Äù name=‚Äùsubmit‚Äù value=‚Äùsubmit‚Äù>Submit</button>             </form>         </div>          //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.21/angular.min.js          http://angularForm.js     </body> </html>
```


A few directives here and there and our markup is ready to be integrated with
AngularJS, let's break it down a bit:

- `ng-app="contact"`: This is the start of our AngularJS application, it tells
  AngularJS that **everything inside** this tag is part of the contact application.
- `ng-controller="contactForm"`: This is the start of our controller,
  controllers in AngularJS are basically functions that control the behavior of
  different features in our website.
- `ng-submit="form.$valid && sendMessage(input)`: This tag binds a function to
  our onSubmit event, additionally, it only runs when the form [with name] ‚Äúform‚Äù
  is **valid**.
- `ng-show="success"`: This attribute reads the value of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù sent by
  AngularJS and only displays the tag if the condition is valid, in this case,
  if ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù or ‚Äúerror‚Äù are true.
- `ng-model`: This one is what AnguarJS calls a ‚Äútwo-way binding‚Äù, it means that
  anything that's written in it can be used by AngularJS, and everything AngularJS
  sends to it will be displayed in the field. Awesome isn't it?

Now let's look at our js file:

```js
(function(angular) {
  var app = angular.module("contact", []);
  app.controller("contactForm", ['$scope', '$http', function($scope, $http) {
    $scope.success = false;
    $scope.error = false;
    $scope.sendMessage = function( input ) {
      $http({
          method: 'POST',
          url: '/processForm.php',
          data: input,
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }
      })
      .success( function(data) {
        if ( data.success ) {
          $scope.success = true;
        } else {
          $scope.error = true;
        }
      } );
    }
  }]);
})(angular);
```

So much smaller than our jQuery counterpart, this is because we don't have any
validation functions going on in here, why's that? Simple, because **AngularJS by
default validates the form before submitting it**. Not only that, but it automatically
adds css classes for valid and invalid fields, thanks Angular.

So the only thing we need to do is make the AJAX request using the `$http`
component, and keep an eye open for the result, let's break it down:

- `angular.module("contact", []):` First we define our module, or our app, and
  all it's external dependencies, in this case there's none. I will also store this
  in the app variable.
- `app.controller("contactForm", ["$scope", "$http", function...`: Then we
  define our `contactForm` controller to handle our form, and it's dependencies,
  $scope is pretty standard but not necessary, you can learn about $`scope` in [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope). 
`$http` is the module we'll use to make AJAX request, since AngularJS works
  with **dependency injection**, we need to let it know that we need it.
- `$scope.success`: we define defaults for our response objects, these might be
  changed later depending of the AJAX response.
- `$scope.sendMessage( input )`: This is the function we'll use to make the AJAX
  request, **it'll take all the input data that we defined in our form**. Then it will
  make a `POST` request to `processForm.php` and set the success or error variables
  depending on the response.

## The problem

At this point, our contact form should be working, but if you try to submit it,
you'll find that **it always returns an error**, why's that?

AngularJS send the data as JSON.

To be fair, the problem **is not caused by AngularJS**. The problem really is that
**PHP does not unserialize this format**. We were able to get around this with jQuery
by making use of the `.serialize()` method, but AngularJS does not provide an
equivalent for this, so what can we do?

## The solution

There's always a couple of ways to almost everything, and this is not the exception,
here I give you two suggestions, you can choose the one that best fit your needs.

### The ‚Äúsave me jQuery‚Äù way

We can use jQuery to get around this problem. Although AngularJS already has a
tiny version of jQuery in it, it does not provide the method we need, this of
course means that we **need to include jQuery along AngularJS**. That doesn't make
me very happy, but it _is_ a workaround. Thanks to the `$.param` method.

```js
(function(angular) {
  var app = angular.module("contact", []);
  app.controller("contactForm", ['$scope', '$http', function($scope, $http) {
    $scope.success = false;
    $scope.error = false;
    $scope.sendMessage = function( input ) {
      input.submit = true;
      $http({
          method: 'POST',
          url: 'processForm.php',
          data: angular.element.param(input),
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }
      })
      .success( function(data) {
        if ( data.success ) {
          $scope.success = true;
        } else {
          $scope.error = true;
        }
      } );
    }
  }]);
})(angular);
```

Inside AngularJS, jQuery is known as `angular.element`, so in order to use the
method we need, **we need to include jQuery in our HTML**, and call it using
`angular.element`. Now we test our form again, and it works!

### The ‚Äúfix it PHP‚Äù way

As I said before, this is more of a problem with PHP, so why not let it fix it?
It's actually really simple, we can't access our `$_POST` variables the usual way,
but we can access them using `file_get_contents`, so we'll change our PHP to this:

```php
<?php
    $response = array( 'success' => false );
    $formData = file_get_contents( 'php://input' );
    $data = json_decode( $formData );
    if ( $data->submit && empty( $data->honeypot ) ) {
        $name = $data->name;
        $email = $data->email;
        $message = $data->message;
        if ( $name != '' && $email != '' && $message != '' ) {
            $mailTo = 'example@mydomain.com';
            $subject = 'New contact form submission';
            $body  = 'From: ' . $name . "n";
            $body .= 'Email: ' . $email . "n";
            $body .= "Message:n" . $message . "nn";
            $success = mail( $mailTo, $subject, $body );
            if ( $success ) {
                $response[ 'success' ] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    echo json_encode( $response );
?>
```

And there! Now we can access our data, and our AngularJS code wasn't changed.

## Conclusion

Forms in AngularJS can be a little tricky, or perhaps it's time to move on to
newer technologies, I'm pretty sure this kind of problem wouldn't happen if I
were to use NodeJS instead of PHP.
