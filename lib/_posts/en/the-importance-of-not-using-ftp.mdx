When you start in the world of WordPress development, one of the first and most basic
things you will encounter is: **installing your site**. Whether locally to upload it
later to your server, or directly to your server (not recommended).

The site needs to be hosted somewhere so that it can be visited by users. Obviously,
since the end user cannot see our site if it remains on our computer, unless we turn
it into a personal server, which is not very recommended.

However you start, it will always be necessary to move our installation to our server,
the question is: How do we do that? The most common (and in almost all cases wrong)
answer is: _use FTP_.

## What is FTP?

FTP stands for _File Transfer Protocol_. It is basically used to move files between
computers (our computer â†’ the server and vice versa). It is one of the most basic
ways to achieve this.

## Why not use FTP?

FTP is popular for its ease of use. There are countless FTP clients that only require
us to drag our files from one side of the client (our PC) to the other (the server)
and voilÃ , our file has been uploaded to the cloud.

However, there are many, _many_ reasons why using FTP today is a _very bad_ idea.

## 1. It's ancient

FTP has been around since the beginning of the internet. The first specification of
the protocol was written in _1971_, and its last update was in 1998, _20 years ago_.
Fun fact, do you know HTTP? well when the first version of HTTP was launched _it already
surpassed FTP in every way_.

## 2. Firewall issues

I'm not 100% sure how common this is, but one of the problems I've encountered doing
this research is that FTP doesn't play well with Firewalls, for reasons that go straight
to the way FTP works.

The problem is that during the FTP transfer it opens simultaneous connections. One
of them on a randomly selected port, which ends up causing the Firewall to block that
connection (since we don't know which port it will come from). Many times forcing us
to disable the Firewall, _bad idea_.

## 3. It's not secure

Perhaps the most important point I want to touch on is that FTP is probably _the
most insecure tool you can use_ for a couple of reasons:

- It does not support encrypted files. This means that anything you send using FTP
  can be viewed and taken by any possible character who is spying on your connection.
  _Security risk_.
- Likewise, even when you use a username and password to protect your connection,
  _they are not encrypted_. Anyone who is spying on your connection can clearly see
  your username and password, and now they have _access to your server_. It's like
  sending a locked suitcase with a padlock, and sending the key to the padlock attached
  to the suitcase.

## Safe versions of FTP

Due to the multiple problems that FTP has, it is not surprising that attempts have
been made to solve them in the past. The most important of course is **security**.
And for this, many answers have been given, such as _sFTP_.

sFTP is a version of FTP that runs through _SSH_, which makes the connection finally
encrypted. Solving one of the biggest problems of FTP, right?

sFTP **protects the files while they are on the way**. However, there is a small
(or large, depending on how long the transfer lasts) moment when our files are exposed:
_At the moment of receiving them_.

The system needs to download the file before it can encrypt it. The longer the file,
or the longer the connection, _the more time an attacker will have to be able to
see the file_. But, considering that an attacker must already have access to the system
to achieve this, I think that file would be the least of our problems.

## So, what can I use?

For now I suggest you move _immediately_ to sFTP, at least. I would recommend using
**a combination of SSH and Git** to manage your sites. Do you want to know how to do it?
