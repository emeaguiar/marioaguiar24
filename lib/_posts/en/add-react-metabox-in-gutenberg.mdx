Recently I found myself in the need to add controls to the **WordPress block editor**, or
_Gutenberg_ as the project is also called, this is usually very simple but had a couple
of complexities that I had not seen before:

1. I needed to have controls in React and
2. It needed to be positioned at the bottom of the editor

These requirements by themselves are not a major problem, but **together** it was something that is not usually done.

## The problem

The issue here is that it is easy to do both separately, we can add a new plugin to the
editor and show it on **the sidebar**, or, we can add a metabox with PHP and
**it will automatically show at the bottom of the editor**.

Do you see the problem? **There is no way to add a Gutenberg plugin at the bottom, and we cannot add 
React controls in PHP**.

_…Or can we?_

## The solution

It turns out that the solution is much simpler than I thought, what we need is **a combination of both** 
to make this work, basically, we can do the following:

1. Create a *metabox* that appears at the bottom of the page, this **only shows a container**
2. We create a Gutenberg plugin with the react functionality we need, this will be shown in the sidebar by default
3. **We create a *portal* that moves our React component to our container within the metabox**

That's the magic! Now let's see how we can do it with code.

## Register a Metabox in WordPress

Now, if we want to do it with code, the first thing we need to do is create a Plugin that adds our metabox:

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php

/**
 * Plugin Name: Mah React metabox
 * Author: Mario Aguiar
 * Author URI: https://www.marioaguiar.net
 * Plugin URI: https://www.marioaguiar.net
 * Version: 1.0
 */

namespace Mah;

/**
 * Handles metabox functionalities
 */
class Metabox
{
    /**
     * Adds the necessary hooks
     * 
     * @return void
     */
    public function init(): void
    {
        add_action('add_meta_boxes', [$this, 'register_metabox']);
    }

    /**
     * Adds a metabox
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register_metabox(): void
    {
        add_meta_box(
            'mah-metabox',
            __('Mah metabox'),
            function () {
                echo "<div id='mah-metabox-content'></div>";
            },
            null,
            'normal',
            'high'
        );
    }
}

(new Metabox())->init();
`}
/>

What this will do is **add a new metabox to the block editor**, if we don't look closely, we can guess
that _it is empty_ (although it simply doesn't have text), something like this:

[![Image of the empty metabox](/posts/add-react-metabox-in-gutenberg/empty-metabox.webp)](/posts/add-react-metabox-in-gutenberg/empty-metabox.webp)

## Register a Plugin in Gutenberg

This will serve as **the container for our React component**, now, for our component
we can add a new file, simply create a Gutenberg plugin using
[registerPlugin](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-plugins/#:~:text=to%20be%20rendered.-,registerPlugin,-Registers%20a%20plugin):

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import { registerPlugin } from '@wordpress/plugins';
import { PluginDocumentSettingPanel } from '@wordpress/editor';

registerPlugin( 'mah-metabox', {
    render: () => {
        return (
            <PluginDocumentSettingPanel
                name="mah-metabox"
                title="Mah Metabox"
            >
                <h2>Mah Metabox</h2>
            </PluginDocumentSettingPanel>
        );
    },
} );
`}
/>

Now we need to add our file to the editor:

<Code
	language="php"
	children={`/**
 * Adds the necessary hooks
 * 
 * @return void
 */
public function init(): void
{
    // …
    add_action('enqueue_block_editor_assets', [$this, 'enqueue_assets']);
}`}
/>

<Code
	language="php"
	children={`/**
* Include scripts and dependencies in our plugin
 *
 * @return void
 */

public function enqueue_assets(): void
{
    $asset_file = include plugin_dir_path(__FILE__) . 'build/index.asset.php';

    wp_enqueue_script(
        'mah-metabox',
        plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . 'build/index.js',
        $asset_file['dependencies'],
        $asset_file['version'],
        true
    );
}`}
/>

And the result would be something like this:

[![Image of the plugin in the sidebar](/posts/add-react-metabox-in-gutenberg/plugin-in-sidebar.webp)](/posts/add-react-metabox-in-gutenberg/plugin-in-sidebar.webp)

Now we have the two components we need, and **we are ready to put them together**.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> Contrary to what this might make us think (and how simple it would be to do all this), **there is no

## Joining the Gutenberg plugin with our Metabox

Fortunately, this is incredibly simple thanks to the aforementioned `createPortal`,
we just need to modify our plugin to **create a portal and send our component through that portal**:

<Code
    language="jsx"
    children={`/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import { createPortal } from '@wordpress/element';
import { registerPlugin } from '@wordpress/plugins';

const Metabox = () => (
    <h2>Mah Metabox</h2>
);

const MetaboxPortal = () => (
    createPortal(
        <Metabox />,
        document.querySelector( '#mah-metabox-content' )
    )
);

registerPlugin( 'mah-metabox', {
    render: MetaboxPortal,
} );`}
/>

Done! That's all we need, what we are doing is creating a portal to our element with id `mah-metabox`,
so, when React runs `MetaboxPortal` it will know that **it has to send its content through the portal**,
and it will end up showing our component right where we need it, which is our metabox:

## Conclusion

This is quite useful when we need more space than our sidebar can give us, a good example is the plugin
[Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) that shows the post information below the editor,
which makes editing it much easier.

Once all these steps have been followed, we only need to add our controls as if we were working on any other
React project, and that's it, we already have a **metabox in React in Gutenberg**. With the advantage of being
able to access the post data and modify it directly from our component through the components in `@wordpress/data`.
