In the [first part of this tutorial](/blog/create-a-settings-page-in-wordpress-with-react),
I showed the basic principles to **create a settings page in WordPress**, in
this second part, I will show you how to use the components included in WordPress
to **add text fields, and save the options**.

## Step 1: Creating our application

To create a settings page, we need to **add some fields**. To start, we must open the
`settings.js` file where we will start our application, and create a simple one:

`settings.js`

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import { createRoot } from '@wordpress/element';

/**
 * Internal dependencies
 */
import Settings from './components/settings';

const rootElement = document.querySelector('#mah-settings');

if (rootElement) {
  createRoot(rootElement).render(<Settings />);
}
```

`components/settings.js`

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
  return <h1>{__('Select the desired options', 'mah-settings')}</h1>;
};

export default Settings;
```

Among the things we can observe in this piece of code are:

1. The use of `createRoot` with which we start our applications in React, but
   unlike how it is normally used, this time we take it from `@wordpress/element`.
   This is because **WordPress already comes with its own copy of React** that ensures that
   its components will work.
2. Likewise, it comes with a javascript version of the `__` function for translations,
   unlike PHP **there is no version of** `esc_html__` so we use the normal version.

> [!CAUTION]

> **Using React**

> As you can see from this small piece of code (and the title of the post...).
> This tutorial assumes that you have at least a basic knowledge of ReactJS, if
> not; I invite you to study it a bit so you don't lose the thread of this topic.

## Step 2: Add some options

Now that we have our application running we can start to **add options to our page**, one of the most common I come across is text fields, perhaps for an API, for example:

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import { Card, CardBody, TextControl } from '@wordpress/components';
import { useState } from '@wordpress/element';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
  const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{__('Select the desired options', 'mah-settings')}</h1>
      <Card>
        <CardBody>
          <TextControl
            help={__('Enter your API key', 'mah-settings')}
            label={__('API Key', 'mah-settings')}
            onChange={setApiKey}
            value={apiKey}
          />
        </CardBody>
      </Card>
    </>
  );
};

export default Settings;
```

After reloading the page, we can see that **our options page** takes shape!
although we can add some flavor, but we will do that later, now that we have our field, let's explain what happens here:

1. Some more WordPress components are added, this time they are `Card`, `CardBody`, and `TextControl`.
   In reality the important one is TextControl since it is the one we will use to enter our options
2. We import `useState` from `@wordpress/element` (once again, React comes included)
3. We add an empty state that will be updated when we change something in `TextControl`
4. The use of React fragments, only that we use its shortened version, instead
   of `import { Fragment } from '@wordpress/element'` we simply use `<></>`

> `@wordpress/components` comes with many components available, I suggest

> to see a demonstration of what we have at our disposal

As a bonus, let's add a `toggle` simply because I like how they work:

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import {
    Card,
    CardBody,
    CardDivider,
    TextControl,
    ToggleControl,
} from '@wordpress/components';
import { useState } from '@wordpress/element';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
    const [ apiKey, setApiKey ] = useState( '' );
    const [ toggled, setToggled ] = useState( false );

    return (
        <>
            <h1>{ **( 'Select the desired options', 'mah-settings' ) }</h1>
            <Card>
                <CardBody>
                    <TextControl
                        help={ **( 'Enter your API key', 'mah-settings' ) }
                        label={ __( 'API Key', 'mah-settings' ) }
                        onChange={ setApiKey }
                        value={ apiKey }
                    />
                </CardBody>
                <CardDivider />
                <CardBody>
                    <ToggleControl
                        label={ __( 'Activate functionality', 'mah-settings' ) }
                        onChange={ setToggled }
                        checked={ toggled }
                    />
                </CardBody>
            </Card>
        </>
    );
}
export default Settings;
```

### What happened?

If we reload the page, we realize that our `toggle` looks more like a checkbox, what happened?

![Toggle as checkbox](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyfxhbbnf/image/upload/v1731511638/plain-toggle_hota9x.webp)

What happens is that despite our javascript dependencies being automatically added to our script,
the same does not happen with our **style dependencies**. So it may be necessary to add them ourselves to the file
`class-mah-settings.php` in a similar way to what we did with the javascript script:

`class-mah-settings.php`

```php
/**
 * Registra los scripts y estilos.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function enqueue_scripts(): void {
    $screen = get_current_screen();

    if ( $screen->id !== $this->menu_slug ) {
        return;
    }

    $asset = include $this->plugin_path . '/build/settings.asset.php';

    wp_enqueue_script(
        'mah-settings',
        plugins_url() . '/mah-settings-react/build/settings.js',
        $asset['dependencies'],
        $asset['version'],
        true
    );

    wp_enqueue_style( 'wp-components' );
}
```

When we reload the page we will see the desired result, and if we look closely,
**our text field also improved in appearance**:

## Step 3: Register options in the backend

To be able to save our options, we need to have values in the database where to save them,
WordPress basically handles the following types:

- Theme mods[^1]
- Post meta2[^2]
- Site Options3[^3]

In our case we will use **global options**, due to the nature of our options page.

In php, we can register them like this:

`php/class-mah-settings.php`

```php
/**
 * Registra los hooks.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function init(): void {
    add_action( 'admin_menu', [ $this, 'add_menu_page' ] );
    add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', [ $this, 'enqueue_scripts' ] );
    add_action( 'admin_init', [ $this, 'register_settings' ] );
    add_action( 'rest_api_init', [ $this, 'register_settings' ] );
}
```

`php/class-mah-settings.php`

```php
/**
 * Registra las opciones.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function register_settings(): void {
    register_setting(
        'mah_settings',
        'mah_api_key',
        [
            'description'       => __( 'API Key', 'mah-settings' ),
            'sanitize_callback' => 'sanitize_text_field',
            'show_in_rest'      => true,
            'type'              => 'string',
        ]
    );
    register_setting(
        'mah_settings',
        'mah_function',
        [
            'description'       => __( 'Funcion X', 'mah-settings' ),
            'show_in_rest'      => true,
            'type'              => 'boolean',
        ]
    );
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> The second rest_api_init hook is necessary to be able to use our options in React,
> otherwise `show_in_rest` would have no effect

## Step 4: Add save button with React

Now we just need to **save our options** from the React side, for which we need to add a save button to our application, and add an event when it is pressed:

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import {
  Button,
  Card,
  CardBody,
  CardDivider,
  CardFooter,
  TextControl,
  ToggleControl,
} from '@wordpress/components';
import { useState } from '@wordpress/element';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
  const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState('');
  const [toggled, setToggled] = useState(false);
  const saveSettings = () => {
    console.log('Save');
  };
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{__('Select the desired options', 'mah-settings')}</h1>
      <Card>
        <CardBody>
          <TextControl
            help={__('Enter your API key', 'mah-settings')}
            label={__('API Key', 'mah-settings')}
            onChange={setApiKey}
            value={apiKey}
          />
        </CardBody>
        <CardDivider />
        <CardBody>
          <ToggleControl
            label={__('Activate functionality', 'mah-settings')}
            onChange={setToggled}
            checked={toggled}
          />
        </CardBody>
        <CardFooter>
          <Button disabled={!apiKey} onClick={saveSettings} variant='primary'>
            {__('Save', 'mah-settings')}
          </Button>
        </CardFooter>
      </Card>
    </>
  );
};
export default Settings;
```

A brief explanation of what we just added:

1. We bring a new component `CardFooter`, which will help us **maintain the style** of our card
2. We bring the `Button` component that comes with WordPress, this gives us some
   advantages over using regular buttons, such as the fact that it **already comes with styles**
   for example, this time we use the `primary` variant. And we make sure
   that it remains disabled if the API key field has not been filled
3. We add the `saveSettings` function that will be in charge of **saving our options**

So when we click the button we will see how our action is registered in the console,
now we just need to **replace it with the real save function**.

## Coming soonâ€¦

My original idea was to finish the tutorial in this part, but I realized how long the post is becoming and there are still quite a few concepts I want to touch on, so I have decided that this is a good time to finish this post and return next week with a third part where we will save our options, finish creating a settings page; and we will see concepts like:

- The use of `useDispatch`, `useEntityProp`, and `saveEditedEntityRecord`
- UX improvements for our page
- General introduction to the `@wordpress/data` package and the use of _stores_.

In the meantime you can check the code of this second part in [my repository](https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-settings-react/tree/parte-2).

As always your comments and suggestions on what you would like to see explained in this humble blog are welcome. Until next time!
