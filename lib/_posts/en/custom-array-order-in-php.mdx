Recently I found myself in the need to **create a list of elements in a very specific order**
while working with an array in PHP, fortunately it turns out that the way to achieve
it is very simple, thanks to PHP offering us the `usort` function.
Next, I will mention how to achieve a custom order of arrays in PHP.

## The code

Taking the following example, I will explain what it consists of:

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php
/**
 * Array to order.
 * Let's assume we receive this array from an API where we have no control.
 */
$my_array = [
    'DO',
    'FA',
    'LA',
    'MI',
    'RE',
    'SI',
    'SOL',
];

/\*\*

- Order we want, where we have control.
  \*/
  $custom_order = [
  'DO',
  'RE',
  'MI',
  'FA',
  'SOL',
  'LA',
  'SI',
  ];

/\*\*

- We order the array.
  \*/
  usort(
  $my_array,
  function( $a, $b ) use ( $custom_order ) {
  $a_order = array_search( $a, $custom_order );
  $b_order = array_search( $b, $custom_order );
  if ( false === $a_order ) {
  $a_order = 999;
  }
  if ( false === $b_order ) {
  $b_order = 999;
  }
  return $a_order - $b_order;
  }
  );

var_export( $my_array );
?>
`}/>

### What is happening?

What the function does is not very complex, let's say, it is a loop that iterates
over each element in the array, and compares them with each other, finally
assigning them a temporary value. The magic happens here when using [array_search](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-search.php),
which returns the index of the element within the array. **The lower the assigned value,
the higher priority is given in the order**.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`/**
 * Array with emphasized indices:
 */
$custom_order = [
    [0] => 'DO',
    [1] => 'RE',
    [2] => 'MI',
    [3] => 'FA',
    [4] => 'SOL',
    [5] => 'LA',
    [6] => 'SI',
];`}
/>

For example, when our algorithm compares `DO` vs `MI`, it is comparing `[0]` vs `[2]`,
which are the indices of those elements in the array:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`if ( false === $a_order ) {    
    $a_order = 999;
}
if ( false === $b_order ) {
    $b_order = 999;
}`}
/>

If **it does not find the values** within the array `(false === $a_order)`, it automatically assigns
a value of _999_, which would place them at the end of priorities.

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`return $a_order - $b_order;`}

/>

Finally, it returns the result of `0 - 2`, or `-2`, which would place `DO`
above `MI`, at the moment when `MI` vs `DO` is compared, the operation would be `2 - 0`,
with a result of `2` which would keep `MI` below `DO` in priority.

In this way, when the comparisons are finished, we will have our custom order of arrays in PHP ready.

 * Array of teams received from an API
 */
$teams = [
    [
        'id'     => 9384,
        'league' => 'NBA',
        'type'   => 'basketball',
    ],
    [
        'id'     => 89732,
        'league' => 'MLB',
        'type'   => 'baseball',
    ],
    [
        'id'     => 52,
        'league' => 'MLS',
        'type'   => 'football',
    ],
];
/**
 * Order by preference
 */
$custom_order = [
    'football',
    'basketball',
    'baseball',
];
/**
 * We order the array.
 */
usort( $teams, ... ); // Same as we used before.
var_export( $teams );
/**
[
    [
        'id'     => 52,
        'league' => 'MLS',
        'type'   => 'football',
    ],
    [
        'id'     => 9384,
        'league' => 'NBA',
        'type'   => 'basketball',
    ],
    [
        'id'     => 89732,
        'league' => 'MLB',
        'type'   => 'baseball',
    ],
];
*/`}
/>
