Despite the advances in _Gutenberg_ that we have seen in recent years, with the idea
that the options of a post (or a page) should be managed **within the WordPress
editor** (a.k.a Gutenberg). Many times we still find ourselves in the need to have
a page where we can manage all our global options, outside of each post in
particular. Next, I will show you how to **create an options page in WordPress with
React**.

## Decisions, decisions…

Like everything in WordPress (and in development in general), we have several options,
one of them is to use _Customizer_, or we use an options page. What are the differences
between these?

### Option 1: Customizer

Customizer is the part of WordPress that has been created to _customize_ our site
(“customise”), it was created precisely for this, and with it you have its pros and
cons:

#### Pros

- It was designed specifically for this purpose
- Each option can be added to your custom panel, or to a general one
- It offers live preview to see the changes immediately
- It offers a range of existing controls to make the job easier

#### Cons

- It will be discontinued in the not too distant future
- Its library of controls is not very wide
- The most custom controls can be difficult to implement

### Option 2: Options page

On the other hand, if we create our own options page, we have more control over our
result; however, at the same time, we have to create everything ourselves[^1].

#### Pros

- Total control over what we do
- Can live anywhere in the administration
- We can use the [Settings API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/settings-api/) to make the job easier

#### Cons

- Requires more code

For the purposes of this tutorial, I will use option two, but with an important
difference. I will not use the mentioned _Settings API_, but instead I will use
**React**, with the help of the existing components in Gutenberg.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why React?**
>
> Throughout my career, I have created countless options pages, each one different
> from the last, but one thing that almost all have in common is the need to add
> Javascript to the options, that's why in this tutorial I will skip that realization
> and instead start doing it with React from the beginning.

Now, after this _huge_ introduction (I'm sorry!) we can start with the tutorial.

## Step 1: Creating the local environment

Since this is a technical tutorial, I will assume that you have some knowledge
about how to start a local project, I would normally say that you can use any
environment you want, and I still say it, I will only ask that **it is capable of
using node** and that you install the package `@wordpress/scripts` (as in my tutorial
[Compiling CSS and Javascript with wp-scripts](/compiling-css-and-javascript-with-wp-scripts)).

> [!NOTE]
> **Using wp-env**

> If you are not very familiar with local environments, I invite you to watch my
> video [Creating a local environment for WordPress with WP-ENV](https://youtu.be/K5Uxc3H-kaU?si=H93NqzLg-DsPWJW1) on youtube where I explain an easy way to achieve it with the tools that WordPress offers.

After having our local environment, we can **create our plugin**, in this case we
need a very simple one, just a class that we will start to be able to register our
page:

`mah-settings.php`

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Mah Settings
 * Description: Tutorial to create an options page with React
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Author: Mario Aguiar
 * Author URI: https://marioaguiar.net
 * License: GPLv2 or later
 * Text Domain: mah-settings
 */
namespace Mah_Settings;
require_once __DIR__ . '/php/class-mah-settings.php';
use Mah_Settings\Settings;
// Exit if accessed directly.
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
    exit;
}
$settings = new Settings();
$settings->init();`}
/>

`php/class-mah-settings.php`

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`<?php
/**
 * @package Mah_Settings
 */
namespace Mah_Settings;
/**
 * Handles the options page
 */
class Settings {
    /**
     * Registers the hooks.
     * 
     * @return void 
     */
    public function init(): void {
        var_dump( 'My page' );
    }
}`}
/>

Once these files are created, we can enter our site and see `My page` at the top, this
means that our plugin is working.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why a class?**
>
> While all this code could go only in the file where we register our plugin, it is
> a good practice to separate each component into its own class, it helps us to have
> things more organized and to prevent conflicts with other types of code that we use.

## Step 2: Create an options page in WordPress

Once we have our plugin working, we will replace the content of the `init` function
with the `admin_menu` hook, which helps us to register our page in the menu:

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`/**
 * @var string
 */
private $plugin_path = '';
/**
 * Menu slug.
 * 
 * @var string
 */
private $menu_slug = '';
public function __construct( string $plugin_file ) {
    $this->plugin_path = plugin_dir_path( $plugin_file );
}
/**
 * Registers the hooks.
 * 
 * @return void 
 */
public function init(): void {
    add_action( 'admin_menu', [ $this, 'add_menu_page' ] );
}
/**
 * Registers the options page.
 * 
 * @return void 
 */
 public function add_menu_page(): void {
    $this->menu_slug = add_menu_page(
        __( 'Mah Settings', 'mah-settings' ),
        __( 'Mah Settings', 'mah-settings' ),
        'manage_options',
        'mah-settings',
        [ $this, 'render_settings_page' ],
        'dashicons-admin-generic',
        99
    );
 }
/**
 * Renders the options page.
 * 
 * @return void 
 */
public function render_settings_page(): void {
    ?>
    <div class="wrap">
        <h1><?php esc_html_e( 'Mah Settings', 'mah-settings' ); ?></h1>
        <div id="mah-settings"></div>
    </div>
    <?php
}`}
/>

There are a couple of important things happening here, I will try to explain them briefly:

1. The `add_menu_page` function simply registers a link in the left menu of the administration, in it we add the title, the capabilities (or permissions) required to see that menu, and **specify which function should be executed when that menu is accessed**, which in this case will be `render_settings_page`. This function returns the _hook_ of this new page, which we will save for later.
2. In the `render_settings_page` function, which will be shown when this page is accessed, we simply add a title (optional) and an _empty container_. **Why do we add this? Because it will be filled with React**.

## Step 3: Register our scripts

To be able to register our scripts within the page, first we need to create them, so we will start by using the package `@wordpress/scripts` that we talked about earlier, so in a terminal we run:

<Code
    language="bash"
    children={`npm install --save-dev @wordpress/scripts`}
/>

After this we can update the configuration to compile our new files, either within the same `package.json` or with a simple webpack configuration file, so we create a file called `webpack.config.js` and place the following:

`webpack.config.js`

<Code
    language="js"
    children={`const defaultConfig = require( '@wordpress/scripts/config/webpack.config' );
module.exports = {
    ...defaultConfig,
    entry: {
        ...defaultConfig.entry(),
        settings: './js/src/settings.js',
    },
};`}
/>

`package.json`

<Code
    language="json"
    children={`"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "start": "wp-env start",
  "stop": "wp-env stop",
  "build": "wp-scripts build",
  "dev": "wp-scripts start"
},`}
/>

`js/src/settings.js`

<Code
    language="js"
    children={`console.log( 'Hello settings' );`}
/>

Basically we are **extending the default configuration provided by WordPress** to add a new file: `settings.js`, after this we can run `npm run dev` so that our file is watched and each new change is compiled.

![Editor view with the created files](/posts/create-an-options-page-in-wordpress-with-react/editor-config.webp)

After having our files created, we can register them with the `admin_enqueue_scripts` hook

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`public static function init(): void {
    add_action( 'admin_menu', [ $this, 'add_menu_page' ] );
    add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', [ $this, 'enqueue_scripts' ] );
}`}
/>

<Code
    language="php"
    children={`/**
 * Registers the scripts and styles.
 * 
 * @return void 
 */
public function enqueue_scripts(): void {
    $screen = get_current_screen();
    if ( $screen->id !== $this->menu_slug ) {
        return;
    }
    $asset = include $this->plugin_path . '/build/settings.asset.php';
    wp_enqueue_script(
        'mah-settings',
        plugins_url() . '/mah-settings-react/build/settings.js',
        $asset['dependencies'],
        $asset['version'],
        true
    );
}`}
/>

Now I will explain a little what happens here:

1. We get the information of the current page using `get_current_screen`
2. We compare the ID of the current page with the hook we saved when we created the page, if it is the same, we continue; if not, we end here.
3. Finally we register our new script using the dependencies that are added to the file (thanks to `@wordpress/scripts`)

If everything went well, we will have our file working on the page:

![WordPress options page with React printing "Hello Settings" in the console](/posts/create-an-options-page-in-wordpress-with-react/settings-page.webp)

## What's next?

In part 2 of this tutorial, I will explain how we can add the React part to our site 
using the components of `@wordpress/components`. For now, I hope this introduction 
has been useful for creating an options page in WordPress with React and please let 
me know if you have any questions. If you want to see the source code I used in this tutorial you can do it [my repository](https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-settings-react/tree/parte-1)
