import AlignWide from '@/components/blog/align-wide';
import { SampleButton } from '@/examples/add-a-back-to-top-button-in-react/en';

One of the most common (and useful) functionalities today is to **add a ‚Äúback to 
top‚Äù button** to our pages, especially when our content tends to be long.

And the truth is that it is not very difficult to achieve, with a few lines of
code you can achieve something very flashy, like what I have on this blog (which
I really liked the result).

So below I will leave the steps I took to add a ‚Äúback to top‚Äù button in React to
this blog, which although it is made with _Next.js_, in the end it is still React.
Let's get started:

- [Step 2: Add the code for ‚Äúback to top‚Äù](#step-2-add-the-code-for-back-to-top)
- [Step 3: Style the button](#step-3-style-the-button)
- [Step 4: Show the button when we scroll down the page](#step-4-show-the-button-when-we-scroll-down-the-page)

## Step 1: Add the button

For practical purposes, in this tutorial I will use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
(since it is what I use on the blog). But **I will explain the reasoning** in terms
of **CSS** so that it is easily transportable to any other system.

### Step 1.1 Creating the button

The basic functionality of a back-to-top button is nothing more than an _anchor_
on the page, which we will link in our button to make a ‚Äújump‚Äù to the top of the page.
For example:

```jsx
<main id=‚Äúcontent‚Äù>
    [‚Ä¶our content]
</main>
```

And at the bottom of our site we add our button:

```jsx
<a href=‚Äú#main‚Äù>Back to top</a>
```

In theory **that's all we need**, but honestly it is a bit outdated, and the jump
can seem sudden to many people, so most of the time we add a little Javascript to
make the jump smoother.

Let's start by creating the button in React:

## Step 2: Add the code for ‚Äúback to top‚Äù

To create a button in React, the first thing we need is a component that allows us
to make the jump. In this case, I will call it `BackToTopButton`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function BackToTopButton() {
    return (
        <a href="#main">Back to top</a>
    );
}
```

And then, in our main component, we import it and add it at the end

```jsx
import BackToTopButton from './BackToTopButton';

export default function Main() {
    return (
        <main id="main">
            [‚Ä¶our content]
            <BackToTopButton />
        </main>
    );
}
```

That will add the button to the end of our page, now, to make the jump smoother,
what we need is to add a little Javascript, to use the `scrollTo` function of Javascript.
Also, since we are using Javascript to handle the jump, it is more optimal not to use
an `anchor` in the button, but to use a `button` instead.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function BackToTopButton() {
    // Function to make the jump when clicked.
    const handleClick = () => {
        window.scrollTo({
            top: 0,
            behavior: 'smooth', // Makes the jump smoother.
        });
    };

    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Back to top</button>
    );
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Why don't we use an `anchor`?**
>
> When we use the `a` tag with an `href` pointing to an `id` on the page,
> we are effectively creating a _link_ to some part of our page. But
> in this case, instead of a link, we are creating **a user interaction**.
> Therefore, it is more semantic to use a `button` instead of an `anchor`.
>
> Also, when using a button we don't have to worry about preventing the default
> behavior of the browser, since buttons don't have a default behavior.
> In other words, we don't need to add `e.preventDefault()` in the event handler.

### 2.1 How does `scrollTo` work?

The way `scrollTo` works is quite simple, we simply pass it an object with the
properties `top` and `behavior`. The `top` property is the position (in pixels)
we want to jump to, in this case `0` to go to the top of the page.

The `behavior` property is what **makes the jump smoother**, since we are
telling it to do it `smoothly`. If we don't pass this property, the jump will be
instantaneous.

We can also pass other properties like `left` to make a _horizontal jump_, but
in this case we don't need it.

## Step 3: Style the button

Now that we have our button, we need to give it a little style. In my case,
I will use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as I mentioned earlier,
but you can use any style system you prefer.

Basically what we will do is make a **circular button that contains an arrow
pointing upwards**. To do this, we need to add a little CSS to our component.

> [!TIP]
> Tailwind uses _inline CSS classes_, so we don't need to import a styles file,
> we simply add the classes directly in the component.
>
> Below this example I will show you how to do it with normal CSS.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function BackToTopButton() {
    const handleClick = () => {
        window.scrollTo({
            top: 0,
            behavior: 'smooth',
        });
    };

    return (
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
          }}
          className="fixed bottom-0 right-0 z-50 m-4 rounded-full bg-primary p-2 text-white shadow-lg ring-1 ring-secondary"
        >
          Back to top
        </button>
    );
}
```

### 3.1 How to do it with normal CSS?

If you prefer to use normal CSS, you can do it like this:

```scss
button {
    background-color: var(--color--primary); // Or our primary color.
    border: 1px solid var(--color--secondary); // Or our secondary color.
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); // Defined by Tailwind.
    color: white;
    inset-block-end: 0;
    inset-inline-end: 0;
    margin: 1rem; // 16px or "4" in Tailwind terms.
    padding: 0.5rem; // 8px or "2" in Tailwind terms.
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 50;
}
```

Basically, what we are doing is creating a circular button with a primary background
color, a secondary border, a shadow, and white text color. Also, we are positioning
it in the bottom right corner of the page. And specifying that it should _always_
stay there.

For our arrow icon, we can use an icon from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/),
which is an open-source icon library, created by the Tailwind team.
In this case, we will use the `arrow-up` icon:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ArrowUpIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/solid';

export default function BackToTopButton() {
    const handleClick = () => {
        window.scrollTo({
            top: 0,
            behavior: 'smooth',
        });
    };

    return (
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
          }}
          className="fixed bottom-0 right-0 z-50 m-4 rounded-full bg-primary p-2 text-white shadow-lg ring-1 ring-secondary"
        >
          <ArrowUpIcon className="h-6 w-6" />

          <span className="sr-only">Back to top</span>
        </button>
    );
}
```

This will give us a result similar to the following (try clicking it üòâ):

<AlignWide>
  <SampleButton />
</AlignWide>

> [!TIP]
> **What is `sr-only`?**
>
> `sr-only` is a Tailwind class that hides an element visually, but keeps it
> accessible to screen readers. In this case, we are using a `span` with the
> text ‚ÄúBack to top‚Äù so that screen readers know what the button does.

## Step 4: Show the button when we scroll down the page

Now we have our button on the page, however there are several adjustments we can
make, for example, **we don't need to add a ‚Äúback to top‚Äù button if we are at the
top of the page**. Therefore we should only show the button when the user has
scrolled down a bit, so that it makes sense.

Since we are using React, we can use the `useState` hook to handle the _state_ of
our button. For example, we can create a state called `showButton` that is `true`
when the user has scrolled more than `100px` on the page.

To know where the user is on the page, we can use the `window.scrollY` property of
Javascript, which will give us the number of pixels the user has scrolled down the
page. This together with the `scroll` event, which will check every time the user
scrolls.

Finally, to make the check more efficient, we can use the `useEffect` hook that
saves a reference to the `scroll` event **and removes it when the component is unmounted**.
We always have to think about the _cleaning_ of our components.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { ArrowUpIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/solid';

export default function BackToTop() {
  const [showButton, setShowButton] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Function to show the button when the user has scrolled more than 100px.
    const toggleVisibility = () => {
      if (window.scrollY > 100) {
        setIsVisible(true);
      } else {
        setIsVisible(false);
      }
    };

    // Add the scroll event.
    window.addEventListener('scroll', toggleVisibility);

    // Clean the event when the component is unmounted.
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('scroll', toggleVisibility);
    };
  }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
  };

  return showButton && (
    <button
      onClick={handleClick}
      className="fixed bottom-0 right-0 z-50 m-4 rounded-full bg-primary p-2 text-white shadow-lg ring-1 ring-secondary"
    >
      <ArrowUpIcon className="h-6 w-6" />

      <span className="sr-only">Back to top</span>
    </button>
  );
}
```

With this, we already have a ‚Äúback to top‚Äù button that is displayed when the user
has scrolled more than `100px` on the page. And that also makes a **smooth jump**
to the top of the page.

## Improvements for the future

This is a fairly basic ‚Äúback to top‚Äù button, but there are many improvements we can
make, for example:

- **Animations**: We can add animations to the button to make it appear and disappear
  more smoothly (as on this blog).
- **Custom styles**: We can customize the button with styles more in line with our site.

And many other improvements we can make! But for now, this button is a good start
to add a very useful functionality to our site.
