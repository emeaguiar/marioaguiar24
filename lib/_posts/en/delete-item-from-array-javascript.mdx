Many of the simplest things are the ones that give us the most headaches,
despite having many years of experience in the world of web development, I still
have to Google the most basic things practically every day. That's why I've
decided to simply create my **own version of these tips**, so I have a reference
on my site when I inevitably have to look them up again, this time. _Remove items
from an array in Javascript_.

## Remove an item using `.splice()`

The `.splice()` method is probably the easiest way to manipulate arrays, it allows
us to add, replace, or remove a certain element based on its index, example:

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const array = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
// Starting at position 1, remove the next element
const removedElement = array.splice( 1, 1 );
// [ 'foo', 'baz' ]
console.log( array );
// [ 'bar' ]
console.log( removedElement );`}
/>

The advantage of this method is: It doesn't _remove_ the element from the array,
it _moves_ it. Basically the method returns any value that has been removed from
the array, in this case we store it in a new constant, for future use.

Another point to note, is that we can remove _several_ elements using this same
method, we just need to increase the quantity in the second argument.

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const array = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
// Starting at position 1, remove the next two elements
const removedElement = array.splice( 1, 2 );
// [ 'foo' ]
console.log( array );
// [ 'bar', 'baz' ]
console.log( removedElement );`}
/>

## Remove the last item using .pop()

The `.pop()` method is something like the opposite of `.push()`, while `.push()`
Adds a new element to the end of an array, `.pop()` removes the last element
from an array, example:

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const array = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
// Remove the last element from the array
const removedElement = array.pop();
// [ 'foo', 'bar' ]
console.log( array )
// 'baz'
console.log( removedElement );`}
/>

Like `.splice()`, `.pop()` will return the “removed” element so we can use it in
the future. However, note that this time we receive a `string`, and not an `array`.

## Remove the first item using .shift()

The `.shift()` method is the opposite of `.unshift()`, and these in turn are opposite
to `.pop()` and `.push()`, while the latter work _at the end_ of the array, the
former do their magic at the _beginning_ of the array.

`.shift()` will remove the _first_ element in our array, example:

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const array = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
// Remove the first element from the array
const removedElement = array.shift();
// [ 'bar', 'baz' ]
console.log( array );
// 'foo'
console.log( removedElement );`}
/>

Once again, note that the value we receive is a `string`

## Remove an item based on its value

So far we have seen how to remove elements based on their _index_, but what
happens when we need to remove something based on its _value_?

The procedure is similar, but in this case we need to first _find the index_ of
the element with that value.

To find the index we can use `.indexOf()`, and we use it in conjunction with `.splice()`,
example, let's remove “bar”:

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`let array = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
let removedElement;
// Remove the first instance of 'bar'
if ( array.indexOf( 'bar' ) > -1 ) {
    removedElement = array.splice( array.indexOf( 'bar' ), 1 );
}
// [ 'foo', 'baz' ]
console.log( array );
// [ 'bar' ]
console.log( removedElement );
// Reset for the next example
let index;
array = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'bar' ];
// Remove all instances of 'bar'
while ( ( index = array.indexOf( 'bar' ) ) > -1 ) {
    removedElement = array.splice( array.indexOf( 'bar' ), 1 );
    
    // [ 'bar' ]
    console.log( removedElement );
}
// [ 'foo', 'baz' ]
console.log( array );`}
/>

Note the comparison to make sure the index exists, if it doesn't exist, it will return `-1`.
Usually a failed comparison would return `0`, (translating to `false`), but since arrays
start at index `0`, it wouldn't help us much, right?

## Remove items using .filter()

Finally, we can use the `.filter()` method to create a new array with the desired values,
technically this method does not remove the elements from the array, since the original
array does not change. Example, let's create a new array without “bar”:

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const array = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
// Returns everything that is not "bar"
const newArray = array.filter( element => element !== 'bar' );
// [ 'foo', 'baz' ]
console.log( newArray );
// [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ]
console.log( array );`}
/>

## Conclusion

So we can see that, like many things in life (and in Javascript), despite not being
as simple as it should be, there are many ways to achieve our goal, so I hope these
ways of removing elements from an array in Javascript are useful to you.
