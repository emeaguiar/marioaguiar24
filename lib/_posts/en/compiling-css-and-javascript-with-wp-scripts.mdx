Ever since the appearance of Gutenberg, or probably before, several **official WordPress
packages** have been implemented to make our lives as developers easier, so to speak.

One of them, and probably one of the most used by us as Frontend Developers is
`@wordpress/wp-scripts` which serves us to **compile Javascript and CSS**
within our project, and in this small tutorial I will cover the basics to be able
to use it quickly.

## What is `wp-scripts`?

In basic terms, it is nothing more than **a collection of resources specifically designed
for frontend development**, each with its recommended configuration,
contains among other things:

- Compiler
- Linter
- Format
- Packer
- Tests
- Local environment

## Installation

To start, we require a simple ppm type package in which **we will define
our application**, for the purposes of this tutorial we don't need much, we can simply run
`npm init` and follow the instructions in the terminal.

`package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "scripts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Simple @wordpress/scripts tutorial",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Mario Aguiar",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wordpress/scripts": "^18.0.1"
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Why `--save-dev`?
>
> By using that flag we are implying that **the installed dependency should be saved**
> as such in the `package.json` file in that way we make sure that any other member of our team
> who wants to install this application receives all the dependencies when running `npm install`.

## Hello World

Before we start creating and compiling our files it is necessary that we have
an **environment from which to run our application**, fortunately, the scripts package
already comes with one, to use it we just need to
add it to our list of scripts in our `package.json`, like this:

`package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "scripts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Simple @wordpress/scripts tutorial",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "wp-scripts start"
  },
  "author": "Mario Aguiar",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wordpress/scripts": "^18.0.1"
  }
}
```

Now we just need to run it with `npm run start` or `npm start`

This will create an observer in our terminal, which **will update and collect
all our files** when a change is detected, now we can start with our application.

The default configuration will look for our files within `src/index.js`,
so we can start there.

`index.js`

```js
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';
const init = () => {
  console.log(__('Hello World'));
};
init();
```

Now when we look inside our `build` directory we can see the compiled files,
along with their `sourcemap`. The `index.asset.php` file is a very useful file that is
created every time any of the dependencies change, **they are listed in it so that
our application can easily list them within our plugin**, for example:

`plugin.php`

```php
/**
 * Include scripts and dependencies in our plugin
 *
 * @return void
 */
function enqueue_scripts() {
    $asset = include get_stylesheet_directory() . '/build/index.asset.php';
    wp_enqueue_script(
        'mah-scripts',
        get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/build/index.js',
        $asset['dependencies'],
        $asset['version'],
        true
    );
}
```

## Conclusion

At a time when project configuration is probably one of the most complicated things
and the most important at the same time, it is good to know that
**we have tools that make our lives a little easier**, at least
for now.
