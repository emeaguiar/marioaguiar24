I am going to show you some codes and hacks that can be applied to almost any
theme you want, this will add some really cool features to your sidebar and who knows,
it may even get you on a date tonight.

Truth be told, in my early years in **WordPress and theme designing**, I never thought
the sidebar was something useful, in fact, my first theme didn't even had one at all,
but time later, I realized how much in-screen space I was wasting, and changed my mind.
This is a walkthrough for the re-design of the WordPress former default theme _Kubrik's_ sidebar,
prior to this; I added the sidebar to single posts, just in case you are wondering where it came from.

## Creating different sidebars

First of all, we are going to need two sidebar files, name the first one `sidebar.php`
so it works on pages too (this is the default one), then we create a new one which
will be shown in our single posts, let's call this one `sidebar-single.php`

> [!NOTE]
> In `sidebar-single.php` I deleted almost everything, except for the search box and some text.

## Separate Home sidebar from Single sidebar

Now, we need WordPress to separate our ‚Äúhome sidebar‚Äù from our ‚Äúsingle-post sidebar‚Äù,
this is easier if your theme has a single.php file like here, but if not, **I strongly
recommend you create one now, it will save you a lot of troubles in the future.**

To make wordpress show a different sidebar in single posts you just have to open
the `single.php` file, find the call to the sidebar and tell it to **call the new sidebar
instead**, something like this:

Now in our blog we can see this:

**Home:**

**Single Post:**

## What if I don't want a single.php file?

I guess we have a rebel here. Well, **if you really don't want a single.php file
messing around in your theme** you can just use the **index.php** file, to do that just
find the line where the sidebar is called:

<Code language='php' children={`<?php get_sidebar(); ?>`} />

And change it for this:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php
    if( is_single() ) {
        get_sidebar( 'single' );
    } else {
        get_sidebar();
    }
?>`}
/>

That code will show our **single-sidebar** ONLY if we are on a single post. If not,
it will show our **default sidebar**.

OK, **now we have a sidebar just for our single posts**, how can we use it? There are
plenty of ways! For example, do you show **related posts or social icons** below your
posts? Maybe some of this stuff can look better on our new sidebar, let's try it.

## Adding related posts

Let's start by adding some related entries to our post, to do that I am using
the [YARPP plug-in](http://mitcho.com/code/yarpp/) (an old version, don't judge me!), in your
`sidebar-single.php` add the `related_posts()` function (or whatever function your plug-in uses) and
now in your blog you should see something like this:

There is another way to display related posts without needing a plug-in, but
**I just cannot make it work on the sidebar**, still, I don't see any problem in using
a plug-in for this (since it is the only plug-in I am using in this tutorial).

## Adding Social Media buttons

Looks good! Now let's add some **social media buttons like Twitter or Facebook**, I
am using [this set of social icons](http://tydlinka.deviantart.com/art/Set-of-social-icons-109435724).

Here in the default theme I don't have much space, so I will just add twitter
and facebook buttons, but if you want to add more, it's pretty much the same thing.

Adding a Facebook button is easy because you only need to **share the URL**, you just
have to paste the following code to the sidebar.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=<?php the_permalink(); ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/images/facebook.png" alt="Share on Facebook" /></a>`}
/>

**Twitter**, on the other hand, is a little tricky because you want to let your followers
know what are you sharing, so you have to add the title, then, when you only have
140 characters to use, you cannot send the full URL along with the title, therefore,
you need a **short URL**.

There are plenty of services to shorten an URL, and you can even create your own,
but right now you can use services like [tinyurl](http://tinyurl.com/) or [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) if you want.

### Adding ‚Äú+‚Äù to the title

I've found that sometimes in Twitter, if you don't add a plus sign ‚Äú+‚Äù to the title
when sending a tweet from a link, **it shows a horrible ‚Äú%20‚Äù on every space**, luckily,
there is a simple way to fix this.

This goes into your **functions.php** file (noticed the importance of this file already?)

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php
    function twitle( $title ) { 
        $newtitle = str_replace( " ", "+", $title );
        echo $newtitle;
    }
?>`}
/>

You don't really need to create a function just for that, but I think it could be useful later on.

### Using Tinyurl

If you want to use tinyurl here is the code you need, paste it on your functions.php file:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function tinyurl( $url ) {
    $tinyurl = file_get_contents( "http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=" . $url );
    return $tinyurl;
}`}
/>

Now, paste the following code in your sidebar:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=<?php twitle( the_title() ); ?>+<?php echo tinyurl( get_permalink() ); ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/images/twitter.png" alt="Share on Twitter" /></a>`}
/>

> [!NOTE]
> I have not tried this, but according to [WPRecipes2](http://www.wprecipes.com/how-to-automatically-provide-tinyurls-for-your-wordpress-blog-posts)
> it works (I just made a few changes).

### Using bit.ly

I prefer [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) because it lets you **keep a track of your shortened URLs**,
and it is shorter than tinyurl.

First you need to [sign up in bit.ly](http://bit.ly/account/register?rd=/),
and then you will have access to an [API key](http://bit.ly/account/your_api_key/),
again, paste this code into your functions.php file:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`//create bit.ly url
function bitly() {
    // login information
    $url = get_permalink(); //generates wordpress' permalink
    $login = '';//your bit.ly login
    $apikey = ''; //your bit.ly apikey
    $format = 'json';//choose between json or xml
    $version = '2.0.1';
    //create the URL
    $bitly = 'http://api.bit.ly/shorten?version='.$version.'&longUrl='.urlencode($url).'&login='.$login.'&apiKey='.$apikey.'&format='.$format;
    //get the url
    //could also use cURL here
    $response = file_get_contents($bitly);
    //parse depending on desired format
    if(strtolower($format) == 'json')
    {
        $json = @json_decode($response,true);
        echo $json['results'][$url]['shortUrl'];
    }
    else //xml
    {
        $xml = simplexml_load_string($response);
        echo 'http://bit.ly/'.$xml->results->nodeKeyVal->hash;
    }
}`}
/>

Don't forget to fill with your username and API key, after that paste this in your sidebar:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php $bitlyurl = bitly(); ?>
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/home?status=<?php twitle(the_title('','',false)); ?>+<?php echo $bitlyurl; ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/twitter.png" alt="Tweet me!" /></a>`}
/>

> [!WARNING]
> I have not tried this either, source: [DevMoose](http://devmoose.com/coding/automatically-create-a-bitly-url-for-wordpress-posts/)

### Using your own domain

I believe that **using your own domain** is the best way to create a short URL,
it gives you presence, personality and your potential readers know that they are
going to a serious website (yes, that's right). Still, if you have a long domain
(like thisisthebestblogeveraccordingtomymomlol.com) maybe you should use bit.ly or tinyurl.

The easiest way to create a short URL in wordpress is to use ‚Äúthe Post ID‚Äù, just paste this in your sidebar:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<a href="http://www.twitter.com/home?status=<?php twitle(the_title('','',false)); ?>+<?php bloginfo('url') ?>/?p=<?php echo $post->ID; ?>" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/twitter.png" alt="Tweet me!"/></a>`}
/>

That will send twitter something like this: **Hello World http://domain.com/?p=123**,
it's short, but it can be even shorter. In addition, you can change `<?php get_bloginfo('url') ?>`
(which sends your blog URL) for another domain if you like, for example, a hack domain
like aweso.me or bite.me (you know, something cool), just remember that **you have to
own that domain** (don't even think about youtu.be).

### Using your own domain v2.0

Using the previous code, and adding some 301 redirection to our .htaccess file we
can get rid of the `?p=` earning three precious characters.

In the previous code, delete `?p=` so it becomes:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<a href="http://www.twitter.com/home?status=<?php twitle(the_title('','',false)); ?>+<?php bloginfo('url') ?>/<?php echo $post->ID; ?>" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/twitter.png" alt="Tweet me!"/></a>`}
/>

That sends something like this **Hello World http://domain.com/123**, but it also
comes with a pretty 404 error. In order to fix that we have to add this rule to our `.htaccess` file:

<Code
  language='apache'
  children={`#shorturl
RewriteRule ^([0-9]+)$ ?p=$1 [R=301,L]
#shorturl`}
/>

There! Now **our own short URL is working**, and now our sidebar looks something
like this (with working buttons yay!):

## Adding a ‚ÄúShare me!‚Äù URL

You also may want to add a short URL so **your readers can share the post by themselves**,
if so, just add the following code depending the shortening method you chose before:

### Tinyurl

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<form>
<input id="shorturl" name="q" size="30" readonly="readonly" onClick="javascript:this.form.shorturl.focus();this.form.shorturl.select();" value="<?php echo $turl; ?>" type="text">
</form>`}
/>

### Bit.ly

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<form>
<input id="shorturl" name="q" size="30" readonly="readonly" onClick="javascript:this.form.shorturl.focus();this.form.shorturl.select();" value="<?php echo $bitlyurl; ?>" type="text">
</form>`}
/>

### Your own domain v1.0

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<form>
<input id="shorturl" name="q" size="30" readonly="readonly" onClick="javascript:this.form.shorturl.focus();this.form.shorturl.select();" value="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/?p=<?php echo $post->ID; ?>" type="text">
</form>`}
/>

### Your own domain v2.0

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<form>
<input id="shorturl" name="q" size="30" readonly="readonly" onClick="javascript:this.form.shorturl.focus();this.form.shorturl.select();" value="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/<?php echo $post->ID; ?>" type="text">
</form>`}
/>

That will show something like this:

> [!CAUTION]
> You MUST use the same shortening method you used before if you want this to work.

## Adding more posts in the same category

Now let's **add some more posts in the same category as the one we are reading**
(we want the reader to stay in our blog for a while don't we?)

I took this function (well, it wasn't a function when I took it) from the [Agregado theme](http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/09/08/agregado-lifestream-theme-for-wordpress-released/)
(which by the way, really knows how to take advantage of the sidebar), add the
first code in your `functions.php` file, and the second one in your `sidebar-single.php` file.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php
function get_more_category() {
global $post;$categories = get_the_category();foreach ($categories as $category) :$posts = get_posts('numberposts=3&exclude='.$post->ID.'&category='. $category->term_id);if(count($posts) > 1) {?><h2>More <em>in</em> '<?php echo $category->name; ?>':</h2><p><ul><?php foreach($posts as $post) : ?><li><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"<?php the_title(); ?></a></li><?php endforeach; ?></ul></p><?php } endforeach;}<?php get_more_category(); ?>`}
/>

## Showing author info

If you have a blog with more than one author you may want to add a small bio to
each post right? All the others blog do it by showing the info below the post
but since we like to be different, and we are **improving our sidebar**, how about
putting the bio in there? Be sure to fill completely your profile page on the WP admin,
that is what we are going to use.

Once you have done that, paste this in your sidebar:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php the_author_link(); ?> is a <?php the_author_meta('description'); ?>`}
/>

Assuming that I have already put my info on my profile page, this would show something like this:

> Mario is a cool designer who loves making themes, writing blogs and eating babies, in that order.

**Note:** If you want to add a gravatar, use this:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php echo get_avatar( get_the_author_meta('user_email'), '80', '' ); ?>`}
/>

Where ‚Äú80‚Äù is the size (in pixels) of the image, you can change that too. [Source](http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-an-author-info-section-in-wordpress).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting here, the next tricks will fit better on our home sidebar (the `sidebar.php` file).

## Showing most popular posts

In case you want to add a list with your blog's **most popular posts** (well, actually most commented),
you are in the right place.

This goes in your `functions.php` file:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`function most_popular_posts($no_posts = 10, $before = '<li>', $after = '</li>', $show_pass_post = false, $duration='') {
global $wpdb;
$request = "SELECT ID, post_title, COUNT($wpdb->comments.comment_post_ID) AS 'comment_count' FROM $wpdb->posts, $wpdb->comments";
$request .= " WHERE comment_approved = '1' AND $wpdb->posts.ID=$wpdb->comments.comment_post_ID AND post_status = 'publish'";
if(!$show_pass_post) $request .= " AND post_password =''";
if($duration !="") {
$request .= " AND DATE_SUB(CURDATE(),INTERVAL ".$duration." DAY) < post_date ";
}
$request .= " GROUP BY $wpdb->comments.comment_post_ID ORDER BY comment_count DESC LIMIT $no_posts";
$posts = $wpdb->get_results($request);
$output = '';
if ($posts) {
foreach ($posts as $post) {
$post_title = stripslashes($post->post_title);
$comment_count = $post->comment_count;
$permalink = get_permalink($post->ID);
$output .= $before . '<a href="' . $permalink . '" title="' . $post_title.'">' . $post_title . '</a> (' . $comment_count.')' . $after;
}
} else {
$output .= $before . "None found" . $after;
}
echo $output;
}`}
/>

And this goes in your sidebar:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<h2>Popular</h2>
<ul><?php most_popular_posts(); ?></ul>`}
/>

## Showing recent posts

Many blogs (almost all of them) show some **recent posts** in their home, and there
are many plug-ins for that, but I said I wouldn't use more plugins, and I cannot
take that back right?

I took this code from the well known [Recent Posts plug-in](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/recent-posts/),
it's just one function, so it can easily be placed in our `functions.php` file.

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php function mdv_recent_posts($no_posts = 5, $before = '<li>', $after = '</li>', $hide_pass_post = true, $skip_posts = 0, $show_excerpts = false, $include_pages = false) {
global $wpdb;
$time_difference = get_settings('gmt_offset');
$now = gmdate("Y-m-d H:i:s",time());
$request = "SELECT ID, post_title, post_excerpt FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_status = 'publish' ";
if($hide_pass_post) $request .= "AND post_password ='' ";
if($include_pages) $request .= "AND (post_type='post' OR post_type='page') ";
else $request .= "AND post_type='post' ";
$request .= "AND post_date_gmt < '$now' ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT $skip_posts, $no_posts";
$posts = $wpdb->get_results($request);
$output = '';
if($posts) {
foreach ($posts as $post) {
$post_title = stripslashes($post->post_title);
$permalink = get_permalink($post->ID);
$output .= $before . '<a href="' . $permalink . '" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: ' . htmlspecialchars($post_title, ENT_COMPAT) . '">' . htmlspecialchars($post_title) . '</a>';
if($show_excerpts) {
$post_excerpt = stripslashes($post->post_excerpt);
$output.= '<br />' . $post_excerpt;
}
$output .= $after;
}
} else {
$output .= $before . "Can't find any :S" . $after;
}
echo $output;
}
?>`}
/>

Paste this in your sidebar:

<Code language='php' children={`<?php mdv_recent_posts(); ?>`} />

## Showing recent comments

**Blogs are all about the community**, so we want our readers to make a lot of comments,
but they are shy, they need to know that some other cool guy did it before. To make this
happen, we need to show a list with the most recent comments on our blog.

Paste the following code to your `functions.php` file (sorry, but I really cannot remember
where I took this from, it was on my `functions.php` file):

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php
function recent_comments($comm = 5) {
global $wpdb;
$sql = "SELECT DISTINCT ID, post_title, post_password, comment_ID, comment_post_ID, comment_author, comment_date_gmt, comment_approved, comment_type,comment_author_url, SUBSTRING(comment_content,1,30) AS com_excerpt FROM $wpdb->comments LEFT OUTER JOIN $wpdb->posts ON ($wpdb->comments.comment_post_ID = $wpdb->posts.ID) WHERE comment_approved = '1' AND comment_type = '' AND post_password = '' ORDER BY comment_date_gmt DESC LIMIT $comm"; 
$comments = $wpdb->get_results($sql);
$output = $pre_HTML;
$output .= "n<ul class="recentcomments">";
foreach ($comments as $comment) {
$output .= "n<li><strong>".strip_tags($comment->comment_author) ."</strong> <em>on</em> " . "<a href="" . get_permalink($comment->ID)."#comment-" . $comment->comment_ID . "" title="". strip_tags($comment->com_excerpt). "">".$comment->post_title ."</a></li>";
}
$output .= "n</ul>";
$output .= $post_HTML;
echo $output;
}`}
/>

Now we call the function from our sidebar:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php recent_comments(); ?>
`}
/>

## Showing random posts

At this point, **we have a lot of posts showing in our sidebar**, but that is a
good thing right? Posts! Posts everywhere!!

Ok, just add the following code to your sidebar:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<li><h2>Random posts</h2></li>
<li><ul>
<?php
$rand_posts = get_posts('numberposts=5&orderby=rand');
foreach( $rand_posts as $post ) :
?>
<li><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>">
 <?php the_title(); ?>
</a></li>
<?php endforeach;
?>
</ul></li>`}
/>

## Displaying a Blogroll

OK, maybe this is not the ultimate-wordpress-trick, but it is pretty useful when
you have several websites, or you can show all your profiles on twitter,
facebook, linkedin, etc. Just add those links in your wordpress link manager,
and show them with this code:

<Code
  language='php'
  children={`<?php wp_list_bookmarks('title_li=&category_before=&category_after='); ?>`}
/>

## The result

I think now we have a **pretty useful sidebar for our blog**, but if you want,
you can keep adding features as you like, there is no limit!

Here is how my sidebar looks like after a few little fixes:

## Be creative!

Remember, this is just an example, your sidebar doesn't have to look exactly like
mine, but I hope that these tips/tricks help you to take full advantage of your sidebar,
also, **be creative!** Think of different ways to use that sidebar, I saw this blog once
that had the comments in the sidebar. Put yourself in your reader's place,
**how can their experience be improved?**
