During the [second part](/blog/create-a-settings-page-in-wordpress-with-react-part-2) of this tutorial to **create a settings page in WordPress**, I showed how to create a small React application that is displayed within our settings page, added a couple
of fields and styles; and prepared the save button to work. Now what remains is to
**save the data** inside our database and read it within our settings page to make
sure we are not overwriting the data.

## Step 1: Saving our data

Starting from where we left off last time, fortunately WordPress already comes
with its utilities to make our lives easier, and, if we remember that in the second
part we registered our option using `register_setting`, we can use the ID we gave
it to load the saved options in our database like this:

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import {
    Button,
    Card,
    CardBody,
    CardDivider,
    CardFooter,
    TextControl,
    ToggleControl,
} from '@wordpress/components';
import { useEntityProp } from '@wordpress/core-data';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
    const [ apiKey, setApiKey ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site
        'mah_api_key'
    );
    const [ toggled, setToggled ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site',
        'mah_function'
    );
    const saveSettings = () => {
        console.log( 'Guardar' );
    };

    return (
        <>
            <h1>{ __( 'Select the desired options', 'mah-settings' ) }</h1>

            <Card>
                <CardBody>
                    <TextControl
                        help={ __( 'Insert your API key', 'mah-settings' ) }
                        label={ __( 'API Key', 'mah-settings' ) }
                        onChange={ setApiKey }
                        value={ apiKey || '' }
                    />
                </CardBody>

                <CardDivider />

                <CardBody>
                    <ToggleControl
                        label={ __( 'Activate functionality', 'mah-settings' ) }
                        onChange={ setToggled }
                        checked={ toggled || false }
                    />
                </CardBody>

                <CardFooter>
                    <Button
                        disabled={ ! apiKey }
                        onClick={ saveSettings }
                        variant="primary"
                    >
                        { __( 'Save', 'mah-settings' ) }
                    </Button>
                </CardFooter>
            </Card>
        </>
    );
}
export default Settings;
```

With this, we are **reading the value of our option saved earlier**, let's explain a
little how it works:

- We load the `useEntityProp` hook that helps us read properties either from the site
  or from specific posts
- This is evident in **line 18** where we replace `useState` with `useEntityProp`,
  the _hook_ keeps track of our value to maintain a record while it is saved
- Finally, we add a condition to the value of our `TextControl` where we basically say
  that if this value is empty (`null`) then return an empty string instead (`''`)
- We do the same with our _Toggle_, this is **to maintain the same type of data** even
  when nothing is saved earlier

Now we need to **save our data** once the save button is pressed, for this we need to
replace the `saveSettings` function with a call to the functions available in the
`@wordpress/core-data`, and `@wordpress/data` packages

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import {
    Button,
    Card,
    CardBody,
    CardDivider,
    CardFooter,
    TextControl,
    ToggleControl,
} from '@wordpress/components';
import { store as coreStore, useEntityProp } from '@wordpress/core-data';
import { useDispatch } from '@wordpress/data';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
    const [ apiKey, setApiKey ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site
        'mah_api_key'
    );
    const [ toggled, setToggled ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site',
        'mah_function'
    );
    const { saveEditedEntityRecord } = useDispatch( coreStore );
    const saveSettings = () => {
        saveEditedEntityRecord(
            'root',
            'site',
            undefined,
            {
                mah_api_key: apiKey,
                mah_function: toggled,
            }
        );
    };
[…]
```

I have added only the important parts of our modifications, to understand a little more

- We must import `store`, and give it the alias `coreStore` (this is a good practice
  when working with several) where the function we need is stored[^1]
- We load the `saveEditedEntityRecord` option from the **store** using the `useDispatch` hook
- We replace our save function so that **it saves the content of our options** with the function we just loaded

And that's it, now once we make changes to our controls we can see how **their value persists** when reloading the page, and we can use them throughout our site:

![Saving data in WordPress](/posts/create-a-settings-page-in-wordpress-with-react-part-3/field-state.webp)

## Step 2: Improving the experience

Although it is already saving our data, we are not finished yet, right? _Can you see how easily we have to improve the experience?_

### Step 2.1: Loading indicator (Spinner)

The most logical thing I can think of: **we don't know when or how our options have been saved**. There is **no indicator** that tells us that the button worked until we reload the page and see them being loaded into the fields, so we can start with a simple _Spinner_.

With a few modifications and with the help of the `@wordpress/components` package again we can easily place it:

`src/components/settings.js`

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import {
    Button,
    Card,
    CardBody,
    CardDivider,
    CardFooter,
    Spinner,
    TextControl,
    ToggleControl,
} from '@wordpress/components';
import { store as coreStore, useEntityProp } from '@wordpress/core-data';
import { useDispatch } from '@wordpress/data';
import { useState } from '@wordpress/element';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
    const [ isLoading, setIsLoading ] = useState( false );
    const [ apiKey, setApiKey ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site',
        'mah_api_key'
    );
    const [ toggled, setToggled ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site',
        'mah_function'
    );
    const { saveEditedEntityRecord } = useDispatch( coreStore );
    const saveSettings = async () => {
        setIsLoading( true );
        await saveEditedEntityRecord(
            'root',
            'site',
            undefined,
            {
                mah_api_key: apiKey,
                mah_function: toggled,
            }
        );
        setIsLoading( false );
    };
[…]
```

`src/components/settings.js#49-85`

```jsx
return (
    <>
        <h1>{ __( 'Select the desired options', 'mah-settings' ) }</h1>
        
        <Card>
            <CardBody>
                <TextControl
                    help={ __( 'Insert your API key', 'mah-settings' ) }
                    label={ __( 'API Key', 'mah-settings' ) }
                    onChange={ setApiKey }
                    value={ apiKey || '' }
                />
            </CardBody>

            <CardDivider />

            <CardBody>
                <ToggleControl
                    label={ __( 'Activate functionality', 'mah-settings' ) }
                    onChange={ setToggled }
                    checked={ toggled || false }
                />
            </CardBody>

            <CardFooter>
                <Button
                    disabled={ ! apiKey }
                    onClick={ saveSettings }
                    variant="primary"
                >
                    { isLoading && <Spinner /> }
                    { ! isLoading && __( 'Save', 'mah-settings' ) }
                </Button>
            </CardFooter>
        </Card>
    </>
);
```

And the result would be:

![Spinner in WordPress](/posts/create-a-settings-page-in-wordpress-with-react-part-3/spinner.webp)

Let's see what we did:

1. We imported `Spinner` from our WordPress components, **this is what will give us the loading indicator**
2. We brought back `useState`, we will use it to create a loading flag, which is disabled by default
3. We added the `async` condition to our save function, this tells the browser that an `await` is coming
4. We changed our loading flag to enabled (this will show the Spinner), and
   we tell the browser to **wait for the result** of the function with `await`, before disabling our flag again
5. Finally, we indicate the conditions so that **if the flag is enabled show our spinner**, otherwise, show our text

> [!NOTE] 
> **Extra!**
>
> In addition to our spinner, it is often good to **disable** the button so that it cannot be used while our function loads. Can you figure out how to do this?
>
> _Tip: It will be included in the other examples and the repository at the end of the article._

### Step 2.2: Success (or error) message

Another simple thing we can do is provide a **success message** (or error) when the process is finished, this will be a little different from what the WordPress editor does by default[^2], but we still have a component we can use.

We make some modifications to the first part of our file:

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import {
    Button,
    Card,
    CardBody,
    CardDivider,
    CardFooter,
    Notice,
    Spinner,
    TextControl,
    ToggleControl,
} from '@wordpress/components';
import { store as coreStore, useEntityProp } from '@wordpress/core-data';
import { useDispatch } from '@wordpress/data';
import { useState } from '@wordpress/element';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';

const Settings = () => {
    const [ isLoading, setIsLoading ] = useState( false );
    const [ showNotice, setShowNotice ] = useState( false );
    const [ apiKey, setApiKey ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site',
        'mah_api_key'
    );
    const [ toggled, setToggled ] = useEntityProp(
        'root',
        'site',
        'mah_function'
    );
    const { saveEditedEntityRecord } = useDispatch( coreStore );
    const saveSettings = async () => {
        setIsLoading( true );
        await saveEditedEntityRecord(
            'root',
            'site',
            undefined,
            {
                mah_api_key: apiKey,
                mah_function: toggled,
            }
        );
        setShowNotice( true );
        setIsLoading( false );
    };

    return (
        <>
            <h1>{ __( 'Select the desired options', 'mah-settings' ) }</h1>

            <Card>
                { showNotice && (
                    <CardBody>
                        <Notice
                            isDismissible
                            onDismiss={ () => setShowNotice( false ) }
                            status="success"
                        >
                            { __( 'Saved Succesfully', 'mah-settings' ) }
                        </Notice>
                    </CardBody>
                ) }
[…]
```

Basically what we are doing is:

1. Import the `Notice` component from `@wordpress/components`
2. Create a flag that helps us know **when to show the message** using `useState` again
3. When the save process is finished, we enable the flag to show the message
4. Above our options, **prepare the place where the message will be shown** and specify that it should only be shown when the flag is enabled
5. Inside the `Notice` component we specify what the message will be and add a function that **disables our flag** when the close button is clicked

And now when we save our options, we will have a nice **success message** like this:

![Success message in WordPress](/posts/create-a-settings-page-in-wordpress-with-react-part-3/success.webp)

> [!CAUTION] 
> **What if something goes wrong?**
>
> In this example, I have only added a success message, but, in case we also want to know if something has failed (recommended) we could log it with the following modifications.
>
> - Create a state that saves the message we need, as well as its `status`
> - Replace our async await function for a promise of format `.then().catch()`
> - Save the error message in our variable inside the `catch` function
> - Show our message changing the `status` depending on whether it was success or error

## Conclusion

I think our options page is now in a good place, I didn't expect this tutorial to be so long but I hope it was useful for someone. Finally, we managed to **create our options page**, to recap, this is what we have done so far:

- We created our environment, and our plugin
- We created our options page, and registered a _script_ that runs only on it
- We registered our global options, and added our controls in React
- We saved our options in React, and added UX improvements

Finally, if you want to see the complete project you can do it in my [repository on Github](https://github.com/emeaguiar/mah-settings-react/tree/parte-3). Una vez más, todos los comentarios son bienvenidos y cualquier sugerencia sobre qué escribir después también. ¡Hasta la próxima!

[^1]: `Stores` are where the application logic lives, in a Redux format; it is where the application `state` and `reducers` are stored.

[^2]: Inside the editor we would use `createNotice` that would show our message along with the others in the editor, but here there is no editor so we have to improvise.
