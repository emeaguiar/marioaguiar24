One of the things I like the most about WordPress is definitely the **huge community
that has been generated over the years**, very capable and so intelligent that the
enormous success of the tool simply would not be possible without them. Not to mention,
it is thanks to this huge community that many (if not all) of the great functionalities
of WordPress were created.

One of them, and one of the ones I use most commonly, is [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/).

## What is WP-CLI?

In very simple terms, it is nothing more than a **command line** with which we can
control our site, it is based on PHP functions that are executed depending on the
command we use, accepting the parameters we specify. The simplest example I use would
be something like this:

```bash
wp plugin list
```

This, something easy to understand, returns a **list with the plugins of the site**,
if we want to activate one of them, we can simply execute:

```bash
wp plugin activate akismet
```

And that's it! It's that simple to activate a plugin on our site using WP-CLI, as you
can see it saves us a lot of clicks.

## Installation

**WP-CLI** is supported by default in WordPress, but that doesn't mean that anyone can
use it just by having WordPress, the command line is a tool that _must be installed on
the server where our WordPress installation is located_, fortunately, it is very easy
to install. For this article, we will assume that it is a local installation, so we
will need to install the tool on our computer.

> [!NOTE]
> Many local environments (like [wp-env](https://youtu.be/K5Uxc3H-kaU?si=H93NqzLg-DsPWJW1)).
> Already come with the tool installed and ready to use, make sure to read the
> documentation of your system to know if it already comes included, and how to use it.

To install the tool, it is simply necessary to download and run a file, the official
site of [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/#installing) has the instructions, which I copy below:

```bash
# Download the file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar

# Make sure it works
php wp-cli.phar --info

# Move it to our path
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```

Now we just need to run `wp` in our terminal and we will have something similar to this:

```bash
wp --info

# Output

```

## The basics

Once we have the tool installed, we can start using it,
as I mentioned earlier, it is very simple, we just need to run
`wp` followed by the command we want to run, for example, if we want to see the list
of themes installed on our site, we simply run:

```bash
wp theme list
```

And if we want to activate a theme, we simply run:

```bash
wp theme activate twentytwentyfour
```

And so on, the official [WP-CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/)
documentation is very complete and has examples of all the commands we can use.
