WordPress, despite being my favorite daily work tool and the one I know the most,
has still several options and functions I've never used. Not too long ago,
one of them was the [Transients API](https://marioaguiar.net/web/20120430100255/http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API).
Really useful functions to **store temporary data in the database**.

## What are Transients?

In WordPress language, a transient is any piece of temporary data, that means we
**expect it to be deleted**. This is useful if we have information we're going to use
for just a small amount of time and we don't want to fill the database.

Lets say we have a contact form (or comments) where the user will type the name,
email, website and comment, once they're typed the form is sent, 5 minutes later
the user finds an error in our site and wants to get in touch again, does he have
to fill ALL the fields over again? Usually, yes, but using **Transients** we can spare
him the trouble.

## The Code

The Transients API and the Options API are a lot alike, and also really easy to use,
in fact, it's conformed by only three functions:

- `set_transient( $transient, $value, $expiration)`: The function that creates
  our transient, where:
- `$transient` is the transient's **unique name**, this is important since it's
  the key to find the transient later.
- `$value` is the transient content, it can be a string or an array.
- `$expiration` is the important part here, it's the time (in seconds) our data
  will stay in our database, once time's up, the transient will be deleted.
- `get_transient( $transient )`: The function we use to call our transient, where
  `$transient` is the **unique name** we set before.
- `delete_transient( $transient )`: Even though transients are deleted automatically
  when they're out of time, it might be the case we want to delete them manually,
  where $transient is still the **unique name** I talk so much about.

## How are they used?

Following the previous situation (the contact form), I'll show a little example
of transients use, nothing to be worried about, we start with the form:

```php
<form id="transient_test" action="process.php" method="post">
    <fieldset>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input id="name" type="text" name="name" />
        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input id="email" type="email" name="email" />
        <label for="url">URL:</label>
        <input id="url" type="url" name="url" />
        <label for="comment">Comment:</label>
        <textarea id="comment" name="comment"></textarea>
        <input id="submit" type="submit" name="submit" value="submitted" />
    </fieldset>
</form>
```

This will give us a fairly simple form, we take **Name**, **Email**, **URL** and **Comment**.
Also note I'm using HTML5 attributes, don't worry, I'm no hipster.

Once we have the data we must of course process it, to do that we'll need a php
file I've called `process.php`, this one will work more or less like this.

```php
<?php 
    if ( isset( $_POST['submit'] ) ) { // Make sure the form was submitted
        $name = $_POST['name'];
        $email = $_POST['email'];
        $url = $_POST['url'];
        $comment = $_POST['comment'];
        $time = 60*60*24; // Expires in 1 day *
        $this_transient = get_transient($name . '_' . $email); // Search some transient
        if (!$this_transient ) { // If doesn't exist
            set_transient('name_' . $email, $name, $time);
            set_transient('mail_' . $email, $email, $time);
            set_transient('url_' . $email, $url, $time);
        }
        $message = "Name: " . $name . "nnE-mail: " . $email . "nnURL: " . $url;
        $headers = 'From: ' . $name;
        wp_mail("me@me.com", "Transients Test", $comment, $headers); // Send a mail
    }
?>
```

Ok, now this code will take the data we send through the form and search the
database for the key value (our mail), if it doesn’t exist it will create new
transients with names like **name_me@me.com** using the data, these will expire in
24 hours. After that it will send an email with the comment.

> [!NOTE] 
> `$time` must be a time value in seconds, since I have no idea how many seconds
> are in a day** it's easier to let PHP itself to do the math, this is **60 seconds
> × 60 minutes × 24 hours**, even easier: **60″ × 60′ = 1 hour × 24 = 24 hours\*\*.

All right, we have the code to store the transients, now what? Right, we needed
them so the user doesn't have to type them over and over again in the form, in
order to do that we have to modify our form and add a `cookie`:

```php
$cookie = $_COOKIE['transients_test'];
<form id="transient_test" action="process.php" method="post">
    <fieldset>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input id="name" type="text" name="name" value="<?php echo get_transient('name_'.$cookie); ?>" />
        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input id="email" type="email" name="email" value="<?php echo get_transient('name_'.$cookie); ?>" />
        <label for="url">URL:</label>
        <input id="url" type="url" name="url" value="<?php echo get_transient('name_'.$cookie); ?>" />
        <label for="comment">Comment:</label>
        <textarea id="comment" name="comment"></textarea>
        <input id="submit" type="submit" name="submit" value="s ubmitted" />
    </fieldset>
</form>
```

Now the form will check the existence of the cookie called transients_test, which
doesn't exist right now, to create it we have to add the following to the `process.php` file:

```php
setcookie('transients_test', $_POST['email'], time()+86400, '/', $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 0, 0 );
```

That will create the cookie called `transients_test`, with the user's email, will
expire in **86400 seconds** (total seconds in one day) and will be valid for our
entire site.

That's it, we have our contact form which remembers our visitors for one whole day,
after that their data will be erased from our database until the next time they
fill and send the form.

## Notes

Usually the transients are stored in our database table wp_options, but they might
not, some plugins may change they location, that's why it's recommended to use
transients **only with data expected to be erased**. If you want to keep it, use other method.
