  Displaying an RSS feed in WordPress is pretty simple, you can use the built-in
  RSS widget or you can use a plugin. But what if you want to display an RSS
  feed in a post or page? That is a little bit more complicated, but still
  pretty easy.

One of the things I love about **WordPress** is being able to do pretty much anything,
and its built-in functions make this even easier. A few days ago I had the need to create a
template to **fetch and display posts from a feed**. Despite being my first time doing something
like this I got it working in a very short time. even more, I found a couple of ways to do this.

## Option 1: WP_Http

The person who asked me to do the template left me a link to [Ozh's](http://planetozh.com/blog/2009/08/how-to-make-http-requests-with-wordpress/)
blog, where he explains how to use the `WP_Http` class to fetch content from external
sites, a simple, well explained way. Once again, there's more than one way to do this.

### Using the class

The basic form (which Ozh explains in his article), is done by making a call to the class itself.

First we include the class (since WP 3.x)

```php
if( !class_exists( 'WP_Http' ) )
        include_once( ABSPATH . WPINC. '/class-http.php' );
```

Then we make the call and test the conection:

```php
$request = new WP_Http;
    $result = $request->request( 'http://feed.url' );
```

If succesful, then $`result` will be an array with the following data:

- `'headers'`: Array with… headers… like `"x-powered-by" => "PHP/5.2.1"`
- `'body'`: The feeds content, the thing we need. Returns _Raw HTML_
- `'response'`: Array with the server's response, we need `array('code'=>200, 'message'=>'OK')`
- `'cookies'`: Array with cookies info.

Now the good stuff, the implementation:

```php
function fetchFeed2($strFeedURL) { // Feed function
    if( !class_exists( 'WP_Http' ) ) // WP_Http Class
        include_once( ABSPATH . WPINC. '/class-http.php' ); // Include class

    $request = new WP_Http;
    $result = $request->request( $strFeedURL ); // test conection

    if ( ! is_wp_error($result) ) { // No error
        if ( ( $result['response']['code'] = 200 ) && ( $result['response']['message'] = "OK" ) ) {
            return $result['body']; // get data
        } else {
            return  $result = "";
        }
    } else { // error
        return  $result = "";
        $error_string = $result->get_error_message(); // which error was it?
        echo '
' . $error_string . '; // display error
    }
}
```

Now we just have to add this where we want the feed to display.

```php
<?php
    $strFeedURL = "http://feed.url";
    echo fetchFeed2($strFeedURL);
?>
```

Easy right? [source](http://planetozh.com/blog/2009/08/how-to-make-http-requests-with-wordpress/)

### Using functions

As I mentioned before, there's more than one way to use this class, the other way
is to use the functions (instead of the class itself), in this case `wp_remote_get()`.

We could say this is the fastest way to use the class, we just need this code:

```php
$response = wp_remote_get( 'http://feed.url' );
if( is_wp_error( $response ) ) { // error
    echo 'Something went wrong!';
    $error_string = $response->get_error_message(); // which error was it?
    echo $error_string; // display error
} else { // No error
    echo $response['body']; // Display content
}
```

The problem here is that (at least in my case) it returned the content in **XML**,
and I'm not really good with that, how to turn it into simple html?

## Option 2: Simplepie

Mi ultimate solution was to use other method, luckily we have [Simplepie](http://simplepie.org/) already
integrated to WordPress, now we just have to call the function `fetch_feed()`.

```php
<?php
$rss = fetch_feed('http://feed.url');
if (!is_wp_error( $rss ) ) : // Was the object created?
    // How many items we got? (Max 5)
    $maxitems = $rss->get_item_quantity(5);
    // Create an array with items starting with #0
    $rss_items = $rss->get_items(0, $maxitems);
    endif;
?>
```

Let's show the items, just like a WordPress loop

```php
<ul>
<?php if ($maxitems == 0) echo '<li>No items.</li>';
else
// Loop through each feed item and display each item as a hyperlink.
foreach ( $rss_items as $item ) : ?>
<li>
    <a href='<?php echo esc_url( $item->get_permalink() ); ?>'
    title='<?php echo 'Posted '.$item->get_date('j F Y | g:i a'); ?>'>
    <?php echo esc_html( $item->get_title() ); ?></a>
</li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```

This was with no doubts the easiest and fastest way since **it allows me to customize
almost entirely the way the items are displayed**, the use is very similar to the
WordPress loop and it supports a number of tags, every one listed in [Simplepie's documentation](http://simplepie.org/wiki/reference/simplepie_item/start).
