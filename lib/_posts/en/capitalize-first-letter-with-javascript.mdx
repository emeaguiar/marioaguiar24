In this quick tutorial we will learn how to make the first letter of a
`string` uppercase

## The easy way

To begin with, why would we need to do this in Javascript? Isn't it easier with
CSS? Well, yes, it is easier to do this in CSS, but if for some reason we can't
do it that way, we lose nothing by knowing how it's done, but just in case, to
do all this in css we only need:

<Code
  language='scss'
  children={`.test {
    text-transform: capitalize;
}`}
/>

> [!WARNING] 
> `text-transform: capitalize` will be applied to all words within the element

## In Javascript

To achieve this result using javascript, what we need are 3 steps:

1. Find the first letter
2. Convert it to uppercase
3. Join it with the others

Translated to code it would be something like this:

### `charAt`

`charAt( pos )` returns the character that is at the `pos` (position) indicated,
we know that `array` start at position zero, therefore, to find the first character
of our string, we use `charAt( 0 )`.

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const str = 'foo';
const firstLetter = str.charAt( 0 );
console.log( firstLetter ); // f `}
/>

### `toUpperCase`

Now, `toUpperCase` converts **all** the characters sent to uppercase,
that's why it's important that we first find the first letter, so that it only
affects it:

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const str = 'foo';
const uppercaseStr = str.toUpperCase();
console.log( uppercaseStr ); // FOO `}
/>

### `slice`

`slice( start. end )` what it does is **cut a string**, starting from the
character specified in `start`, and ending at the character specified by `end`,
if `end` is not specified, it will simply take the total number of characters of
the string, reaching the end.

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const str = 'foo';
const latterStr = str.slice( 1 );
console.log( latterStr ); // oo `}
/>

Now we have all the necessary parts, we just have to put them together:

<Code
  language='js'
  children={`const str = 'foo';
const firstLetter = str.charAt( 0 );
const upperCaseStr = firstLetter.toUpperCase();
const latterStr = str.slice( 1 );
const result = upperCaseStr + latterStr;
console.log( result ); // Foo
// Short version
console.log( str.charAt( 0 ).toUpperCase() + str.slice( 1 ) ); // Foo  `}
/>
