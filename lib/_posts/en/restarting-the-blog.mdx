Time really flies, especially when you do what you love, or when you _stop doing it_â€¦

It's been a little over 10 years since I started working as a **web developer** professionally,
and nothing could make me happier, it has been a great journey from those days when
I studied architecture, through that stage when I didn't know what to do with my life,
to now where I feel that in several ways, I have finally achieved _success_.

The problem is that I don't have a record of those moments, because I simply stopped
writing them.

When I started, more than 10 years ago with a small blog, writing and reading every
tutorial that came my way, I had no idea that this step would help so much
to my development, and during many moments in my life, I have felt that **I must return
something in return**, I just haven't figured out how.

## How to share knowledge?

With how fast the world changes, especially the internet world, it is difficult
to think about what is the best way to share this type of knowledge, or resources,
written in a blog? Videos on Youtube? Conferences?, or better yet,
a little of everything.

I think in the end, the best way is _any way, just do it_. That's why
I decided to publish again, but this time in a slightly more produced format,

> **And you, who are you?**

## What to expect now?

My intention for some time now is to share not only tutorials
but a little of myself, as a log, as I used to do in the old days,
after all this is a personal blog. Surely I won't be able to write daily but I hope
now if I can do it at least once a week, I have _many drafts_ ready
to be published.

So that's it, I hope you keep coming around here and with some luck
who knows, maybe we'll even learn something.
