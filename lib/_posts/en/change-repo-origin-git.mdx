More than once I have needed to **change the origin of a repository**, so to
make my life easier I decided to make the annotation here.

The first thing you need is a new repository, let's say it is `git@github.com:emeaguiar/mah-theme.git`

Now, the thing is as simple as removing the old origin remote, adding the new one, and configuring it as master.

<Code
    language="bash"
    children={`# Remove old origin
~ git remote rm origin

# Add new origin
~ git remote add origin

# Configure it as master
~ git config master.remote origin`}
/>

Done! Now when you run `git remote get-url origin --all` you will see the new repository.
