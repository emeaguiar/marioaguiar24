One of the most common and useful processes when developing a new website is _the
creation of multiple work environments_ to ensure that our changes or new features
work perfectly _before even approaching production_.

At the same time, one of the most common problems in these cases is the _disconnect
between new environments_, it is not uncommon to have 3 different databases between
local, staging, and production.

Ideally, each of these environments should be an exact copy of production, having
the same “server” (or at least something as close as possible), the same database,
and in increasingly common cases, _the same multimedia files_.

## The problem

While for the database, or servers, it is not so much of a problem to receive a copy
that we can use in our local system, multimedia files generally have a _much larger
size_, and therefore sometimes result in a loss of space by having several copies
of the same file for each of our environments, especially with images that many
systems crop, creating **more and more copies of the same image**.

## The solution

The solution in these cases is actually quite simple, all we need to do is: _use
our production files in our local environment_.

The steps for this may vary, but in my case, _I usually use nginx_, and the steps
for this are to find the configuration file (usually `default.conf` or `site.conf`).
Within this file, we will add a `location` tag, so that it looks like this example:

```plain
# Basic conf
server {
	server_name  _;
	return 302 $scheme://mysite.test$request_uri;
}

# Custom conf

server {
server_name ~^(.\*)\.mysite\.test$ mysite.test;
root /app/public/;

    # If file ends with these extensions
    location ~* ^.+\.(svg|svgz|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|bmp|webp)$ {
    	try_files $uri @image_fallback; # Try this address (defined below)
    }

    # Define URL to try (prod url)
    location @image_fallback {
    	proxy_pass https://mysite.com;
    }

    # More default conf...
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
    include do-not-modify/*.conf;

}
```

Now, every time my server receives a request to one of the files I have defined,
instead of looking for them on my local server, _it will look for them on my
production server_, giving me _the real image I have in production_ without the
need to copy it locally.
